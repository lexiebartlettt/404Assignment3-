<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />

<small>INTRODUCTORY.</small></h2>


<p>My object in writing these hints on <span class="smcap">Conjuring</span> is for the benefit
of amateurs to promote lively and entertaining amusement
for the home circle and social gatherings.</p>

<p>My large experience enables me to explain and simplify many
of the best tricks and illusions of the art. I present the key to
many of the mystical mysteries which have puzzled and bewildered
our childhood days as well as confounded us in our maturer
years.</p>

<p>The young student can in a very short time, if he be in the
least of an ingenious turn, amuse and astonish his friends, neighbors
and acquaintances.</p>

<p>Preference has been given to those tricks which suggest
others, the more complete and difficult performances and
illusions have been passed by as being out of place; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
shall not, therefore, in these elementary papers advert to those
experiments which require ample resources, or a prepared stage,
for exhibiting them—or which can only be displayed to advantage
by consummate skill and the most adroit manipulation—but
confine my remarks at present to those branches of the art
to the performance of which a young amateur may aspire with
prospect of success.</p>

<p>A few hours’ practice will enable the learner to execute the
simple tricks that I shall first treat of; and they will only require
for their display such articles as are readily available in
every household. Most of them will be supplied by any company
of a few friends, and if not in the parlor, can be brought
from no greater distance than the kitchen or housekeeper’s
room; such as handkerchiefs, coins, oranges, or eggs, a
glass bowl, etc., etc. There may only remain a few inexpensive
articles to be supplied from repositories for the sale of conjuring
apparatus, or they may be had direct from the publishers of
this work.</p>

<p>It may be well explicitly to avow that the time is quite gone
by when people will really believe that conjuring is to be done
by supernatural agencies. No faith is now reposed in the
“black art of sorcery,” or even in the art to which the less repulsive
name was given of “white magic.” Many years have
elapsed since conjurors have seriously assumed to themselves
any credit as possessing supernatural powers, or as enabled by
spiritual agency to reveal that which is unknown to science and
philosophy, or mysteriously to work astonishing marvels.</p>

<p>A well-marked contrast exists between the old school of conjurors
and those of modern times. The former, who used boldly
to profess that they employed mysterious rites and preternatural
agency, designedly put the spectator upon false interpretations,
while they studiously avoided giving any elucidation
of the phenomena, nor would ever admit that the wonders displayed
were to be accounted for by the principles of science and
natural philosophy.</p>

<p>Modern conjurors advance no such pretensions. They use as
scientifically as possible the natural properties of matter to aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
in their exhibition of wonderful results. They are content to
let the exhibition of their art appear marvelous. They sometimes
mystify the matter, and so increase the puzzle, in order
to heighten the interest and amusement of the spectators; but
they throw aside any solemn asseveration of possessing hidden
powers, or of ability to fathom mysterious secrets.</p>

<p>It may be admitted that proficients and exhibitors still adopt
language that has become current with conjurors, and in common
parlance it may be asserted that the wonderful Mr. So-and-So
undertakes to pass some solid object through a wall or a table;
to change black into white, and white into black; to place
rings in closely-fastened boxes, or draw money out of people’s
ears; and conjurors may with ridiculous humor distract the attention
of spectators, so that accurate observation is not fixed
upon the object that is to undergo before their eyes some singular
transformation; but no outrageous bombast or positive
falsehoods are commonly advanced. And the practical meaning
of any exaggerated pretension is clearly understood to mean no
more than that Mr. So-and-So undertakes to present before you
what, <span class="smcap">TO ALL APPEARANCE</span>, is the conversion of black into white,
or vice versa; and the audience are clearly aware that no more
is assumed to be presented to them than a very striking illusion,
undistinguishable from a reality; and how this is effected
will be in many cases wholly untraceable, and therefore the
trick is inimitable.</p>

<p>We may be permitted to feel some pleasure in the conviction
that the exhibition of our art in its more striking exploits is
really marvelous, and very attractive; for we certainly have
the power of placing some astonishing phenomena before our
audience; and we may surely prize the estimation with which
the uninitiated are disposed to honor us, but we erect no vain-glorious
assumptions upon these data, as we are quite contented
with fair praise intelligently accorded to us. And so far from
closely concealing the principles and arcana of our science, we
are ready plainly to avow that it all depends upon faculties that
all may attain by patient culture, and exhibit by careful practice.
Undoubtedly there are less and greater degrees of excel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>lence
to be obtained by proportionate intelligence and dexterity.
There are attainments in the art, at which, by natural qualification
and peculiar adaptation, special study, practice, and experience
enable some few only to arrive. These qualifications
cannot be easily communicated to every one who might wish to
possess them; and therefore the highest adepts will ever have
an incommunicable distinction. But this is no more than is
the case in the medical, the legal, and any learned profession,
in all which the most eminent proficients reserve to themselves,
or unavoidably retain, an unquestioned superiority. At the
same time there is much in our art that may be communicated,
and the present papers will show to our friends that we are willing
to impart to others such portions of our art as they are capable
of acquiring; and we trust that what we shall communicate
to them will furnish them much rational recreation among
themselves, and enable them to supply innocent and interesting
amusement to their friends and companions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<small>OF PALMISTRY AND PASSES.</small></h2>


<p>The true nature and limit of the art of Conjuring has now
been defined—what it is that we assume to do, and
wherein we have discontinued the exaggerated pretensions
of the conjurors of the old school; and I have hinted in
what respects, and within what bounds, a young amateur may
gim at exhibiting some amusing experiments in our art. But
it remains for me to explain the grand pre-requisite for a novice
to cultivate before he should attempt to exhibit before others
even the simplest tricks of prestidigitation or legerdemain, to
which we at present confine our attention.</p>

<p>I have first to speak of <span class="smcap">Palmistry</span>, not in the sense that the
fortune-teller uses the word, but as expressing the art of the
conjuror in secreting articles in the <span class="smcap">PALM</span> of one hand while he
appears to transfer those articles to his other hand. It is absolutely
necessary that the young amateur should acquire the habit
of doing this so adroitly as to escape the observation of others
while doing it openly before their eyes.</p>

<p>The two principal passes are the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>FIRST PASS; or, method of apparently carrying an
object from the right hand to the left, while actually retaining
it in the right hand.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader will please to observe that the illustrative sketches
depict the hands of the performer as seen by himself.</p>


<p class="subt">FIRST POSITION OF PASS 1.</p>

<p>The right hand, having the knuckles and back of the fingers
turned toward the spectators, and holding openly a cent, or
some similar object, between the thumb and forefinger, must
be moved toward the left hand.</p>

<p>The left hand must be held out, with the back of the hand
toward the ground, as exhibited in the illustration. (Fig. 1.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>


<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span><br />
First Position of Pass 1.</div>
</div>

<p class="subt">SECOND POSITION OF PASS 1.</p>

<p>The left hand must appear to close over the object that is
brought toward it, at the same instant that the right hand secretes
and withdraws that object.</p>

<p>The left hand that appeared to receive it must continue
closed. The right hand, though it actually retains the object,
must be allowed to hang loosely over it, so that it appears to
have nothing in it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_010-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span><br />
Second Position of Pass 1.</div>
</div>

<p>The performer then may blow upon the closed left hand, and
may say, “Fly,” or “Begone,” or any similar expression, and
then open his left hand, holding it forward. Of course there is
nothing in it, and the object seems to have flown from it, and
the spectators are much surprised.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SECOND PASS.—Method of apparently transferring
an object from the left hand to the right, while retaining
it in the left hand.</p></blockquote>


<p class="subt">FIRST POSITION.</p>

<p>Let the left hand hold up the object in its open palm. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
right hand is brought toward the left hand, but only appears to
grasp it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_011-1.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span><br />
First Position of Pass 2.</div>
</div>


<p class="subt">SECOND POSITION.</p>

<p>The left hand secretes the object in its palm, while the fingers
are allowed to fall loosely down, appearing to retain nothing
under them. At the very same moment the right hand must be
closed, and remain in shape as if containing the object, with the
second joints of the fingers pointed toward the spectators, and
the back of the hand toward the ground. The performer then
holding his right hand forward, may blow on it and say “Change—fly,”
and opening that hand, the spectator deems the object
has passed away from it, though in fact it has remained all along
in the left hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_011-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span><br />
Second Position of Pass 2.</div>
</div>

<p>The illusion in either of these passes is, that the spectator
seeing both hands move as if the object were passing from one
to the other, thinks it has done so; whereas, in fact, the object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
always remains in the hand where it was first visible to the spectators.
The <span class="smcap">BACK</span> of that hand where the object is first displayed
must afterwards be kept well toward the spectators.</p>

<p>Observe, the eye of the performer must rest always on the
hand or object at which he desires the spectators to look, and
whatever he wishes them not to notice, he himself must refrain
from looking at.</p>

<p>If it is not required that the very object that has been held up
in these passes be seen again by the spectators, the performer
must quietly pocket it, or drop it on a handkerchief on his table,
or inside a hat, or otherwise get rid of it as soon as he conveniently
can.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if that very object must be again produced
or transferred to a person standing at some little distance, this
must be effected by one of the following methods:</p>

<p>Either you must take care beforehand to place adroitly in that
person’s cap or pocket a double or similar object.</p>

<p>Or, you must walk up to him, and putting your hand on his
hair, sleeve, or pocket, quickly place there the object you have
all along retained, and which you must pretend by this manœuvre
to find in his possession.</p>

<p>Or, lastly, you will see in the first trick subjoined, a method
of substituting one object for another.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><a id="FIRST_TRICK"></a>FIRST TRICK.—To command a dime to pass into the
centre of a ball of Berlin wool, so that it will not be discovered
till the ball is unwound to the very last of its
threads.</h3>

<p class="subt">REQUISITE PREPARATIONS, TO BE MADE PRIVATELY.</p>

<p>You will require a glass bowl or quart basin, and you must
have a flattened tube of tin about four inches long. It must be
just large enough to let a dime slide easily through it by its own
weight. Round the end on this tube wind a ball of Berlin wool
of bright color, covering about two inches of the tube, and projecting
about an inch beyond the end of it. Place this ball with
the tube in it in your right-hand pocket of coat tail, (or in the
left breast-pocket, if that is large enough to hold it completely
covered.) Lastly, place a dime concealed in the palm of your
left hand.</p>

<p>Commence the exhibition of the trick by requesting one of the
spectators to mark a dime (or cent) of his own, so that he will
be sure to know it again. Then ask him to lend you that coin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Holding it up in your right hand, you may say, “Now, ladies
and gentlemen, this is the marked dime which I shall experiment
with. The gentleman has accurately marked it, so that
there can be no mistake about its identity when reproduced.”
Then by Pass 1 pretend to transfer the marked coin to your left
hand, but in reality retain it in your right hand. Next, hand
with your left hand your own dime (which had been secreted in
that hand) to some person, and request him to hold it. Choose
for this person some one three or four yards distant from yourself,
and also from the person who originally marked the coin.
It is unnecessary to explain that you do so, lest the two should
compare notes. Of course, the person who is asked to hold it
will believe that it is the very dime that was borrowed.</p>

<p>You may proceed to say: “Now we want a ball of worsted.”
So, placing your right hand in your pocket, pretend to feel
about for something in your pocket, and while doing so you
must place the dime in the top of the tin tube, and shake it
down. Then carefully draw the tube out of the ball of worsted;
and leave the tube in your pocket, but draw the ball out of your
pocket, pressing it together while doing so.</p>

<p>Then request some one to feel the ball in order to ascertain
that it has no opening towards its centre.</p>

<p>You may here make some humorous remark about your having
such a ball in your pocket. As for instance:</p>

<p>“Ladies may think it odd that I have such a ball of Berlin
wool in my pocket. It was bought to please my cousin Mary
Ann, or my Aunt Tabitha. Well, it will do very fairly for our
experiment.”</p>

<p>Then request some one to hold the glass basin containing the
woollen ball. While you retain in your hand the end of the
woollen thread, address the gentleman who has consented to
hold the dime, asking him to hand it to you. Take it in your
right hand, pretend by Pass 1 to transfer it to your left hand,
but in reality keep it concealed in your right hand.</p>

<p>Holding up your closed left hand, (which in fact has nothing
in it,) you may say:</p>

<p>“Now, dime, pass along this woollen thread into the very
centre of the woollen ball which is there held in the glass bowl
or basin.”</p>

<p>Blow upon your left hand, and show that the dime is gone.</p>

<p>You must adroitly get rid of the dime, which has remained
secreted in your right hand, by placing it in your pocket or
sleeve while making some humorous remark, or while asking
some lady or gentleman to draw the woollen thread till it is all
unwound. It will be done the quicker by letting the ball be
confined loosely in the bowl with two fingers preventing its
leaping out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>Draw attention to how completely the coin is wrapped up till
you arrive at the very last circles, when it will drop into the
bowl.</p>

<p>Hand the dime to the owner who marked it, and let him declare
whether he recognizes it as the very one he lent you.
His affirmative will surprise the spectators.</p>


<h3><a id="SECOND_TRICK"></a>SECOND TRICK.—To change a bowl of ink into clear
water, with gold fish in it.</h3>

<p class="subt">REQUISITE PREPARATION, TO BE MADE PRIVATELY BEFOREHAND.</p>

<p>The same glass bowl as in previous trick. If your bowl has
not a foot to it, it must be placed on something that will hold it
high above your table. Some small fish, a white plate or saucer,
a piece of black silk just fitting the inside of your bowl, a
spoon of peculiar construction, so that in a hollow handle it will
retain about a teaspoonful of ink, which will not run out as long
as a hole near the top of the handle is kept covered or stopped.
A large tumbler and two or three minnows will do for a simpler
exhibition, but will, of course, not be so pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p>Place the black silk so as to cover the part of the bowl that is
shaded; when damp it will adhere to the glass. Pour in clear
water to fill the space covered by the black silk, and place the
fish in the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Commence the trick in public thus: Holding the spoon-handle
slanting up and uncovering the hole in the handle, the ink
which you have placed in the handle will run into the bowl of
the spoon, and the spoon being held carefully to the surface of
the water, concealing the black silk, will give the spectators the
impression that you fill the spoon from the glass bowl.</p>

<p>Pour the spoonful of ink on a white saucer, and show it round
to convince the spectators it is ink. They will see it is undeniably
ink, and they will conclude, if the spoon were properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
lifted out of the bowl, that the glass bowl contains nothing but
ink.</p>

<p>Borrowing a silk handkerchief, place it for a few seconds over
the bowl, and feigning to be inviting fish to come to the bowl,
exclaim “Change!” Then, placing your hand on the edge of
the bowl near yourself, draw off the handkerchief, and with it
take care to catch hold also of the black silk. The bowl when
uncovered will exhibit the fish swimming about in clear water.
While the spectators are surprised at the fish, return the handkerchief,
having first dropped out of it the black silk on your
side of the table. Decline giving any explanation, as people
will not thank you for dispelling the illusion.</p>


<h3><a id="THIRD_TRICK"></a>THIRD TRICK.—The Dancing Egg.</h3>

<p class="subt">REQUISITE PREPARATION TO BE MADE IN PRIVATE.</p>

<p>An egg-shell that has been blown (my young friends will know
that the way to blow an egg is to make a small hole at each end
of the egg. Then, by blowing at one end, the yolk will be
driven out, and the egg-shell be left empty.)</p>

<p>Make a hole also on the side of the egg, in which insert a
chip of wood, or a small pin, held by a fine black silk thread,
about twelve or fourteen inches long, which must have a loop at
the far end, which loop fasten to a button on the coat or waistcoat;
and have on a dark vest, otherwise the dark thread becoming
visible, will reveal the moving power.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Commence by borrowing two black hats. If there is an instrument
in the room, ask some one to play a lively tune, as
“eggs are fond of lively music to dance to.” Then, with the
brim of a hat in each hand, interpose the round of each hat
successively under the thread that holds the egg, moving them
from your breast toward the egg. The egg will appear to move
of itself over the hats, as you place them under it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>You must not allow people to handle the egg on the thread afterwards,
for when they see the simplicity of the process they
will undervalue the trick, whereas it appears marvellous as long
as they do not understand how the extraordinary movements
are produced. And in these illusions, as Hudibras expresses it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Doubtless, the pleasure is as great</div>
<div class="verse">In being cheated as to cheat.</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3><a id="FOURTH_TRICK"></a>FOURTH TRICK.—The Walking Cent.</h3>

<p class="subt">PRELIMINARY PREPARATION IN PRIVATE.</p>

<p>Ask for a long dark hair from some lady’s tresses. Have a
pin in shape of a hook, or a small loop affixed to the end of this
hair, and fasten a little piece of beeswax (less than a pea) at the
other end of the hair. Fasten the hair by the loop to a button
on your vest, taking care to wear a dark-colored vest. The
hair may be allowed to hang from your vest, with the beeswax
visible. Have a glass of water or cup on the table.</p>

<p>Commence the exhibition of the trick by borrowing a cent.
While pretending to examine the cent to see if it is a good one,
press the waxed end of the hair firmly to the under side of the
cent, and place it about a foot from the edge of a table. Then
bid the cent to move toward you, to the right or to the left, and
by gently moving your body in whatever direction you name,
the hair will draw the cent in the same direction. You may
say, while your left hand is near the table, “Now, cent, move
up my arm.” Advancing your arm gently, the cent will appear
to move up to your elbow. It is your arm that moves, but it
will appear to the spectators as if the cent moved; or you may
help it up the outside of the sleeve by interposing your right
hand under the hair, so as to draw up the cent, while appearing
to beckon it.</p>

<p>“Now, cent, as you have performed so well, you shall have a
bath.” Placing the tumbler near the edge of the table, draw
the cent into it. After exhibiting it in the water, say, “Oh,
cent, you must not stay so long in the water.” Then jerk it out
upon the table. Detach the waxed end of the hair by your
nail, after which return the cent to the person who loaned it
to you.</p>

<p>When performing this trick, in order to keep the spectators at
a little distance, you must inform them that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> “the cent is very
susceptible to magnetic influences, and request ladies not to approach
too near it, as the loadstones of their eyes are the cause
of the magnetic attraction.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></div>
</div>

<p>My young friends must remember that it is absolutely necessary
to keep up in spectators their belief in the mysterious, and
therefore must decline on the spot to give explanations before or
after the performance of this trick, however they may be disposed
to reveal the secret privately to any friend. A singular
instance is recorded of a person who was grievously disappointed
when by importunity he had received an explanation of this very
trick, which had appeared at first to him a most marvellous phenomenon;
and he was quite annoyed when the gilt was stripped
off his ginger-bread. It is said that a gentleman walked into a
coffee-room at Manchester, England, and was exhibiting to a
friend the above trick. A traveler at a table near them had his
attention drawn by their laughing discourse, while one of them
exhibited the trick to the other. The cold barrier of English
reserve was broken down, and he addressed one of the strangers,
requesting to be informed how the trick was done. For his part
he imagined it must be connected with some perfectly new philosophical
law of attraction involved in the experiment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> “Will
you be kind enough to tell me? I shall be happy to offer a fee
to learn it. I was about to proceed by the next train, but I will
gladly defer my journey to understand this, which appears so
unaccountable.”</p>

<p>The gentleman declined for a considerable time; but at
length, being overcome by the importunity, in order to get rid
of the matter, assented. The time of the departure of the train
had arrived and passed by, and the aspirant offered two guineas
to learn the trick. The gentleman acceded to his request on
condition that he should faithfully promise not to reveal it to
others, or to make public the mystery. “Agreed,” says the
traveler. The mail train was gone—the money paid—the trick
exhibited and explained to him. “Oh!” cried the traveler,
“how easy and plain it is. What a simpleton I have been to
lose my journey and spend my money only to learn how you—.”
“Stop!” cried the gentleman, “remember you have promised
not to divulge the secret.” “Yes, but how foolish to care for
an experiment which only depends on—.” “Stop, sir, stop.
Are you going to tell all the room?” and thus a good half-hour’s
amusement was caused by the traveler fretting over his simplicity,
and having relinquished an important journey for that
which, though marvellous while a secret, became so simple and
uninteresting to him after an explanation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<small>TRICKS WITH AND WITHOUT COLLUSION.</small></h2>


<p>In resuming my hints to amateurs, I shall now offer some remarks
upon two subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First.</span>—I will notice the class of tricks that are performed by
the collusion of a confederate. Old books on conjuring record
several of this description, and some conjurors still practise
them. But I do not advise the inexperienced frequently to exhibit
tricks of this sort, for the co-operation of assistants used
in them is liable to be traced by spectators, or to be divulged by
the person who has been employed to aid in the exhibition of
them. They may, indeed, be very well as a make-shift until
dexterity of hand is acquired; but they will always rank as an
inferior branch of the science of conjuring, and if the collusion
is discovered, it will throw discredit even upon those tricks
which the same performer may exhibit without such collusive
arrangement. An instance of the annoying failure of such dependence
upon confederates is recorded in “Houdin’s Memoirs.”
It is there related that Torrini, at the commencement of his career,
was insidiously induced by an envious rival (Pinetti) to
undertake a public exhibition of his art before a very grand assembly.
Torrini was at the time diffident of his own attainments,
but he was persuaded to make the attempt by the assurance
of Pinetti that he would take care that several confederates
should be present, and should help in carrying out sundry
illusions which he would have to display. One of these was,
that the conjuror, after borrowing a ring, was to restore it magi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>cally
into the possession of its owner. The ring was borrowed,
and some mysterious gesticulations practised; but instead of the
contemplated result being produced, the false confederate proclaimed
aloud that he had lent a very valuable jewelled ring, and
had only received back a common copper ring. The audience
was of course disappointed at such words so derogatory to the
conjuror. This unpleasant feeling was deepened by the malicious
meddling of another false confederate. Torrini had to
present some cards to the King of Naples, who was honoring the
assembly by witnessing the exhibition, and a card was selected
by his Majesty. Instead, however, of being pleased with what
he saw on the card, the king manifested intense disapprobation.
The confederate had written on the card words of disrespect and
insult, and Torrini had to retire amid the loud censures of the
enraged spectators. There may be no danger of so disastrous
results to a young amateur; but dissatisfaction of a milder kind
will probably ensue whenever it is discovered that any trick has
depended upon the secret co-operation of an assistant among
the spectators.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">SECOND</span> topic which I propose at present to discuss is the
employment of mechanism—such mechanical constructions as
boxes with false sides, cabinets with secret drawers, or double
compartments, etc.</p>

<p>It makes a great difference whether such arrangements are
used as subordinate aids, or as constituting the essence and substance
of the illusion. In the former respect it is quite legitimate
to take advantage of any well-arranged mechanical aid subordinately.
In fact, nearly all tricks must be performed with
some modified aid of artistic contrivance, or with mechanical
implements adroitly used. The conjuror, therefore, unavoidably
requires, and may advantageously employ, mechanical arrangements
to give greater effect to his illusions. I only wish
to dissuade the learner from relying solely upon mere mechanical
puzzles, or artistic contrivances, for furnishing an interesting
exhibition of the conjuror’s art.</p>

<p>The fewer the contrivances which he employs of this sort, and
the more entirely the performance rests upon sleight-of-hand
the more lively will be the surprise of the spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>I myself prefer doing without the aid of any confederate, and
without mechanical aids; but I must remember that I am writing
for amateurs and novices in the art, and that, in proportion
as they are unpractised in palmistry, and in what the French
term prestidigitation, (preste digite, signifying “ready fingers,”)
it will be desirable for them, at first, to have the assistance
which mechanism will supply towards the exhibition of their
tricks.</p>

<p>Let them, however, keep such aids as subordinate and as secret
as possible. For instance, in the preparation for exhibiting
the first trick described on page 12, the small tin tube (which is
requisite for the performance of that trick) must not be seen by
the audience, either <span class="smcap">BEFORE</span> or <span class="smcap">AFTER</span> the trick is exhibited, but
must be kept secreted in the pocket. Again, in Trick No. 4,
the preparation of the hair and beeswax must be made <span class="smcap">PRIVATELY</span>
beforehand; and these implements must vanish out of
sight when the trick is over. And the reader must observe that
in both the first and fourth tricks the mechanical aid employed
is the minor and subordinate part of the tricks, and that a successful
exhibition of either of them depends really on the dexterity
of the passes, and of manipulations by the performer.</p>

<p>It may be admitted, then, that, with regard to the first topic
of our present paper, the young conjuror need not be restrained
from employing the subordinate aid of an assistant, so far as
this may carry him over difficulties which he cannot otherwise
surmount in the present stage of his imperfect skill.</p>

<p>And in regard to the second topic, the employment of mechanical
contrivances, (though it may be well to begin with
those departments of the art which are easier, because aided by
mechanical apparatus,) it will be desirable for the amateur to
strive to get free from dependence upon such aids. Mechanical
arrangements cannot be wholly discarded at any time, and the
conjuror will always require a few implements; but the more
he advances in dexterity of hand, quickness of eye, control of
his hand and eye, instantaneous adaptation of his words and
movements to contingencies as they arise, the more able will he
become to elude the observation of the most watchful specta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>tors,
and to mislead their imagination, so that they shall fancy
that they see him <span class="smcap">DO</span> things which he only <span class="smcap">APPEARS</span> to do, and
shall blindly fail to observe actions and movements carried out
before their very eyes.</p>

<p>And here let me say, that I have, by long experience, come to
the conviction, that the simpler and more common the objects
are on which, and with which, a trick is performed, and the less
anything beyond dexterity of hand is openly used, the greater
will be the astonishment and the amusement of the spectators.
There are, it is true, some very striking and complicated illusions
which it is impossible to present without resorting to artistic
contrivances of mechanical or scientific arrangement. On
these illusions, as being beyond the power of a young amateur,
I need not dwell. Nor need the preceding remarks be considered
as any disparagement of the combinations and extrinsic aid
which are indispensable for developing such startling illusions.
The scope of my present remarks is simply to this effect, that
to depend mainly upon the co-operation of a confederate, or
upon mechanical contrivances, for what can be far better carried
out by mere sleight-of-hand, will not pass for a satisfactory exhibition
of conjuring now-a-days; and the amateur will find
that, as he advances in skill and dexterity, he will swim more
freely the less he trusts to such unsubstantial bladders to uphold
him.</p>

<p>Having thus discussed my two topics I shall now add explanations
of a few more tricks, which the learner may practise with
the hope of making progress in the art of conjuring. The only
way to make such progress and gain high attainments in the art,
is to practise diligently over and over again the passes I have
described in my former paper, and to learn to do a few tricks
neatly, and without hesitation or stumbling. I subjoin, therefore,
some simple but effective tricks, in which they will do well
to perfect themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_5"></a>TRICK 5.—To make a quarter and a penny change
places, while held in the hands of two spectators.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have a quarter of your own secreted in your right hand.
Then borrow two handkerchiefs, and a quarter and a penny,
from any one in the audience. Tell the lender to mark or accurately
observe them, so that he will know them again. In placing
them on the table, substitute your own quarter for the borrowed
one, and conceal the borrowed one in your palm.</p>

<p class="subt">MEMORANDUM.</p>

<p>It is better to use things borrowed than coin of your own.
Still, the conjuror should provide himself with articles requisite
to display any trick, or otherwise much delay may occasionally
arise while borrowing them.</p>

<p>Commence the trick by pointing out where the quarter and
the penny are lying on the table. Take up the penny and show
it openly to all. Then take up one of the handkerchiefs, and
while pretending to wrap up the penny in it, substitute in its
place the borrowed quarter which you had concealed in your
palm, and ask one of your friends to feel that it is enfolded in
the handkerchief, and bid him hold the handkerchief enclosing
it above his head. Ask him if he has got the penny there safely.
He will reply that he has.</p>

<p>Then take up your own quarter which was laid upon the table;
pretend to wrap it up in the second handkerchief, but
adroitly substitute the penny, (which you concealed in your
palm while wrapping up the first handkerchief.) Ask some
friend to hold it up above his head, indulging in some facetious
remark. Slip your own quarter into your pocket. Clap your
hands or wave your wand, saying, “Change.” Tell your friends
to unfold their handkerchiefs. They will be astonished to find
that the quarter and penny have changed places.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_6"></a>TRICK 6.—Another trick with the dime, handkerchief,
and an orange or lemon.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have an orange or lemon ready, with a slit made in its side
sufficiently large to admit the dime easily; and have in your
pocket a good-sized silk handkerchief with a dime stitched into
one of its corners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>Borrow a marked dime. Take out your handkerchief, and
while pretending to wrap this dime in the handkerchief, conceal
it in your palm, and take care that the one previously sewn into
the corner of the handkerchief can be felt easily through the
handkerchief. Giving it to one of your friends, tell him to feel
that it has the dime in it, and to hold it up over his head firmly.
While giving these directions to your friend, the dime that is in
your palm must be transferred to your pocket, and introduced
into the slit of the orange. Then bring the orange out of your
pocket, and place it on a table; you will keep the slit on the side
away from the audience.</p>

<p>Then make a few mesmeric passes over the hand of the person
that holds the handkerchief, saying, “I will now destroy
the sense of feeling in your hands. Tell me, can you feel the
dime?” He will say, “Yes.” You can reply, “Oh, you must
be wrong, sir. See! I will shake out the handkerchief.” Taking
hold of one corner of it, shake it out, saying, “Observe,
nothing will fall to the ground. You see that you were mistaken
about feeling it in the handkerchief.”</p>

<p>The fact is, the dime being stitched in the ‘corner’ could not
fall out, and you must take care not to let that corner of the
handkerchief hit against the ground. Put the handkerchief in
your pocket, and say, “But I must return the borrowed dime.”
Exclaim: “Fly, dime, into the orange on the table.” Cut up
orange, and show the dime concealed in it, and then restore it
to its owner, asking him to tell the audience if he finds it to be
his own marked dime.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_7"></a>TRICK 7.—How to double your pocket money.</h3>

<p>The only preparation is to have four cents concealed in your
left palm.</p>

<p>Commence the trick by calling forward one of the spectators,
and let him bring up his hat with him.</p>

<p>Then borrow five cents, or have them ready to produce from
your own pocket should there be any delay.</p>

<p>Request your friend, while he places them one by one on a
small plate or saucer, to count them audibly, so that the company
may hear their number correctly. Inquire, “How many
are there?” He will answer, “Five.” Take up the saucer and
pour them into your left hand, (where the other four are already
concealed.) Then say, “Stay, I will place these in your hat,
and you must raise it above your head, for all to see that nothing
is added subsequently to them.” You will have placed
these nine cents in his hat unsuspected by him.</p>

<p>Borrow five cents more. Make Pass 1, as described on page
9, appearing to throw these five into your left hand, but really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
retaining them in your right hand, which is to fall by your side
as if empty.</p>

<p>Afterwards get rid of four of the five cents into your pocket,
retaining only one in your right palm.</p>

<p>Hold up your closed left hand, and say, while blowing on it:
“Pass, cents, from my left hand into the hat. Now, sir, be
kind enough to see if they have come into your possession.
Please to count them aloud while placing them in the saucer.”
He will be surprised, as well as the spectators, to find that the
cents in his hat have become nine.</p>

<p>You may then put on a rather offended look, and say: “Ah,
sir! ah! I did not think you would do so! You have taken
one out, I fear.” Approaching your right hand to his sleeve,
shake the sleeve, and let the one cent, which you have in your
own hand, drop audibly into the saucer. It will raise a laugh
against the holder of the hat. You can say: “Excuse me, I
only made it appear that you had taken one. However, you see
that the original money is now doubled.”</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_8"></a>TRICK 8.—The injured handkerchief restored.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have a dime of your own wrapped in the centre of a piece of
cambric about five or six inches in diameter, the ends falling
down loose. Conceal these in the palm of your left hand.</p>

<p>Borrow a marked dime from any of the spectators, and a
white cambric handkerchief. Throw the handkerchief spread
out over your left palm, (holding under the handkerchief your
own dime wrapped in the small piece of cambric.)</p>

<p>Openly place the borrowed dime on the centre of the spread-out
handkerchief. Keeping hold of that dime, jerk the ends of
the handkerchief over, so as to fall loose down from the lower
side of your left hand. Draw out from between your thumb
and fingers (that is from the upper side of your left hand) about
two inches of the smaller piece of cambric, containing your own
dime. The spectators will naturally conceive the two pieces of
cambric you hold in that hand to be merely the cambric handkerchief.</p>

<p>Call any of the spectators forward, and request him to mark
off with his knife the portion of the piece of cambric which holds
your own dime, and whisper to him to cut it completely off, and
to let the dime drop on the table. The spectators will believe
that he has cut a hole in the handkerchief itself, and that the
dime falling out is the one you recently borrowed, whereas it is
in fact the other piece of cambric that has been cut, and the borrowed
coin remains still wrapped up in the handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Pretend to blame the person who cut the two inches off, saying:
“Dear me, sir, what have you done? You have quite destroyed
this nice handkerchief. Well, I hope, madam, you will
pardon the mistake, if I manage by magic to restore to you your
handkerchief in perfect order, and I request you to allow me to
try to do so.” Carefully holding in the candle the edges of the
cambric, (both of the part cut off and of the portion from which
it was cut,) and letting the real handkerchief hang down from
the same hand, pretend with a conjuring wand to weld together
the edges of the cambric when they get hot, as a blacksmith
welds metals together. You can prevent the flame from reaching
the real handkerchief by tightly pressing your fingers.
Then exclaim: “Oh, where is the dime?” and while picking it
up from the table, get quietly rid of the pieces of cambric with
their burnt edges into a hat or some corner unseen by the audience.</p>

<p>Holding up the dime which you had just lifted from the table
say: “But to complete my trick I must replace this dime in the
centre of the restored handkerchief, whence it was cut out.”</p>

<p>Make the Pass 1, appearing to pass it into the centre of the
handkerchief, but retaining it in your hand, and afterwards secretly
pocket it. The handkerchief has already the borrowed
dime in it. Say to the handkerchief: “Change—restore!” and
unfolding it, show the borrowed coin in it. Shake out the handkerchief
and show it is all sound and right, and restore it with
thanks, as well as the borrowed dime, to the owners.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_9"></a>TRICK 9.—To make a large die pass through the crown
of a hat without injuring it.</h3>

<p>I will now give my young friends a nice, easy trick, requiring
very little dexterity, as the articles for its exhibition can be purchased
at any depot for the sale of conjuring apparatus; therefore
the most diffident amateur will be able to display this trick.</p>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have a die exactly like the common dice, only it may be about
two inches square. Have two covers for it, one of them exactly
resembling the appearance of a die, only hollow, except that
one side of it is open, so that it can easily be placed over, or be
taken off, the solid die.</p>

<p>The other cover may be of decorated material, and it is intended
to be placed over the first die-cover. Let this last cover
be made of some pliant material, so that by compressing gently
two of its sides with your fingers, while lifting it up, you can
lift up the first die-cover, which will be within it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>Commence the trick by borrowing two hats; place one with
its rims upwards on the table, and show that you place in that
hat the die with its first cover on it. But say, “I forgot to appeal
to the company whether they will like to see the trick done
visibly or invisibly.” They will most likely say, “Visibly;” but
it is of no consequence which answer they make, for the process
of the trick is the same in either case.</p>

<p>Take out from the lower hat the first cover, which is painted
exactly like a die, and having placed the second hat (with its
rims downwards) on the other hat, display the first cover, and
openly place it on the crown of the upper hat. All the spectators
will believe it to be the solid die itself. Then take your
penknife; you may just thrust it into the crown of the hat, and
pretend to cut all round the die-cover there lying; say—“I
shall now bid it move into the lower hat, but it will not do so
while uncovered, so I must place this ornamental cover over it.”
Do so; show that you have nothing in your hands or sleeves;
then wave your wand or your hand, and say, “Change, pass,
die, into the lower hat.” Give it a little time. Then, compressing
the outward cover gently, lift off also with it the painted
die-cover, which it has inside it. Lift up the lower hat, and
show the company the solid die lying in it. Show all that the
upper hat has received no injury.</p>

<p>The illusion to the audience will be that the solid die has passed
through the crown of the upper hat without at all injuring
it. Return the hats to the owners, and show them to be uninjured.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_10"></a>TRICK 10.—To produce from a silk handkerchief bon-bons,
candies, nuts, etc.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have packages of various candies, wrapped up in bags of the
thinnest tissue paper, and place them on your table rather sheltered
from observation. Have also a plate or two on your
table.</p>

<p class="subt">MEMORANDUM.</p>

<p>It will be always desirable to have the table removed two or
three yards at least from the spectators, and of a height that
they cannot see the surface of it while sitting down in front of
it.</p>

<p>Commence the trick by borrowing a silk handkerchief, or any
large handkerchief. After turning it about, throw it out on the
table, so as to fall over one of these packages.</p>

<p>Having carefully observed where the bag lies, place your left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
hand so as to take up the bag while catching hold of the middle
of the handkerchief.</p>

<p>Taking the handkerchief up by nearly the centre, the edges
of it will fall around and conceal the bag; make some pretended
wavings of your wand or right hand over the handkerchief, and
say, “Now, handkerchief, you must supply my friends with
some bon-bons.” Squeeze with your right hand the lower part
of the bag which is under the handkerchief; the bag will burst,
and you can shake out into a plate its contents.</p>

<p>Asking some one to distribute them among your young
friends, you can throw the handkerchief (as it were carelessly)
over another bag, from which you can in the same way produce
a liberal supply of some other sweetmeats, or macaroon biscuits,
etc., etc., all of which will be duly appreciated by the juveniles,
and they will applaud as long as you choose to continue
this <span class="smcap">SWEET</span> trick.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<small>PRACTICE.</small></h2>


<p>In conjuring, as in all other arts and sciences, perseverance is
requisite in order to become expert and successful. There
is no royal road, or possibility of acquiring the end, without exercising
the means to that end. Let my young friends, then,
carefully practise over and over again the passes and the tricks
which I have already explained to them. It is the only way to
attain dexterity and confidence, without which they will never
be able to make any creditable exhibition of the art of conjuring.
After they have attained considerable skill and sleight-of-hand
in displaying a few tricks, they will easily extend the range
of their performances, and gradually rise to greater ability. I
may, therefore, parody an old injunction for obtaining success,
and say: There are three rules for its attainment: The first is
“Practice.” The second is “Practice.” The third is “Practice.”
In a word, constant and careful practice is requisite, if
any wish to be successful as amateur conjurors. They should
never attempt to exhibit before their friends any tricks that they
have not so frequently practised that no bungling or hitch is
likely to occur in their performance of it.</p>

<p>Let no one be staggered by the simplicity of the processes
recommended in these tricks. The result will in fact be all the
more astonishing, the simpler the operations employed.</p>

<p>The great point is the address of the performer, and that will
carry through successfully the means employed. However simple
and insignificant those means may appear to the learner
when they have been explained to him, if there is good address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
and accurate manipulation, the astonishment at the result will
be infinitely greater than any one would imagine possible to be
produced by such simple means.</p>

<p>There is one help that I can suggest towards the better management
of the hands in concealing or removing objects; it is
the use of a conjuror’s rod or short magic wand. This is, now-a-days,
commonly a stick of about fifteen inches long, resembling
a common rule, or a partially-ornamented one. You may
often have observed this simple emblem of the conjuror’s power,
and deemed it a mere idle or useless affectation. The conjuror
waves it mystically or majestically as he may be disposed. Of
course you are right in your judgment that it can do no good
magically; but it does not follow that it is useless. The fact is,
that it is really of considerable service to him. If he wants to
hold a coin or any object concealed in his hand, without others
observing the fact of his hand being closed, the wand in that
hand is a blind for its concealment. He may require to pick up
or lay down some object, and he can do so while openly fetching
or laying down his wand. If he wants to gain time, for any illusion
or process of change, he can obtain it while engaging the
attention of the spectators by some fantastic movements of his
wand. By the use of the wand, therefore, you will be able to
prevent the observation of your audience too pointedly following
the movements which you wish to carry on secretly. You
may also, at the same time, dispel their attention by humorous
remarks, preventing it from being concentrated on watching
your movements.</p>

<p>As a general rule, you must not apprise your audience of what
you are actually doing, but must often interpose some other
thought or object to occupy their mind. For instance: Do you
desire that a person should not examine too closely any object
which you place in his hand, tell him to hold it well above his
head. That takes it out of the range of his eyes. It would
never do to tell him not to look at it. He would then immediately
suspect that you are afraid of something being observed.</p>

<p>Have you perchance forgotten to bring on your table any article
requisite for displaying any trick, a feint must be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
that you must have more candles, or must remove some other
object, thus gaining the opportunity to fetch what you require
without naming it.</p>

<p>Do not even announce too fully or vauntingly beforehand
what is to be the result or development of any trick; rather
proceed with it, and let the audience come unexpectedly upon a
result which they had not contemplated. Their surprise will be
greater, and their amusement more lively, at such unexpected
result.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that it will be well to avoid the repetition
of the same trick in the same evening, though requested to perform
it over again. The minds of the spectators have already
traced once the whole performance of it—the beginning, the
middle, the end. The zest of it, therefore, is gone off; their
minds are languid and disinterested about its second repetition;
and the conjuror’s art proportionately sinks in their estimation.</p>

<p>Having offered these general remarks, I will now invite the
attention of my young friends to another batch of interesting
tricks, which, with a little effort, they may succeed in exhibiting.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_11"></a>TRICK 11.—A sudden and unexpected supply of feathers
from under a silk handkerchief or cloth.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have ready a good supply of plumes of feathers. They may
be obtained from a fur or fancy store, or purchased there loose,
and tied up so as to lie thin and flexible where you wish to place
them. You may have at least four batches of them. The common
hackle feather will do, stitched round a thin piece of whalebone.
Feathers that are a little injured for sale as ornaments
may be picked up at little cost.</p>

<p>Take off your coat. You may then have one or more batches
of feathers placed round each arm; the lower point of the stem
on which the feathers are fixed being near your wrist, and the
top of each batch of feathers confined near your elbow by a
slight worsted string, so that they do not stick out the coat
sleeve too much, or slip down together if two batches are concealed
in the same sleeve. You can have one or more batches
placed just within each side of your waistcoat, with the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
point of the stem within easy reach of your hand—about four
inches below your chin. Then put your coat on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span><br />
Position 1.<span class="i5">Position 2.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Commence the trick by borrowing a large silk handkerchief or
cloth of the same size. Show it to be empty by holding out the
two top corners in front of your breast, and shake the handkerchief
while it falls loosely down over your vest. Then moving
the handkerchief toward your left, catch hold (with your right
thumb and finger) of the end of the stem of the plume, No. 1,
and draw it from under the left side of your vest. It will remain
concealed behind the handkerchief while you move your
two hands to the right, which will draw out the plume from under
your vest, then over the centre of your chest. Then toss
the handkerchief about, enveloping the first batch of feathers;
say, “Handkerchief, you must supply me with some feathers.”
In a minute or so, take off the handkerchief, and display the
plume to the spectators.</p>

<p>Show the spectators again that the handkerchief is quite
empty. Move your arms toward your right till your left hand
comes just over the edge of the right side of your vest. With
your left thumb and forefinger catch hold of the stem of the
feathers there concealed, and by moving your arms back towards
the left, you can draw out without its being observed the
plume that had been concealed under the right side of your
vest. Toss about and display as before this second batch of
feathers, and then place them aside.</p>

<p>Then show to the company again that your handkerchief has
nothing in it, and lay the handkerchief over both your hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
While waving it mysteriously about, exclaim that the handkerchief
must furnish you with some more feathers. Draw out of
the left sleeve one of the plumes, shake the feathers out while
taking off the handkerchief from this, which will be plume the
third.</p>

<p>Then, throwing your handkerchief over the hand, and clapping
your hands together, (with the left over the right hand,)
manage to catch hold of another point of a plume, and pull it
out from your right sleeve while waving about your two hands
with the handkerchief over them. You have now produced four
plumes.</p>

<p>The exhibition may be continued to an increased number of
plumes, if you have more concealed in your sleeves, or elsewhere;
but four will probably be sufficient to manage at the
commencement of your career as an amateur conjuror.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_12"></a>TRICK 12.—Heads or Tails?</h3>

<p>I shall now give directions for reproducing, before a juvenile
audience, a trick that will carry us back to the primitive style of
conjuring in old times. I cannot say that there is anything
very scientific or elevated in it, but, if neatly and adroitly executed,
it will tell very well with a youthful audience.</p>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>You must take care that your table be so placed that none of
the spectators can see behind yourself or the table. You must
provide yourself with some young pet of the juveniles, such as
a puppy, a kitten, or any other small pet. The performer must
either have some little bag hanging under his coat-tails, or some
provision for concealing the little animal behind him, or in a
drawer before him; so that there will be no chance of any of
the audience seeing it before the proper time. He must have
ready also a penny, or any coin.</p>

<p>To begin the exhibition of the trick. Standing with all the
nonchalance you can assume, and placing one or both your arms
behind your back, you may say, “For a variety, I will challenge
one of my young friends to come and try which of us will succeed
best in a few tosses of this penny.”</p>

<p>Induce some young person to come to the front of your table,
and tell him to bring forward his hat. Ask him to toss first
with the cent and put the hat over it, while you will guess
“heads” or “tails.” Say it shall be seen who is most success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>ful
in five guesses. After he has tossed up twice, you can take
the penny, and say, “Now, I will vary the method of tossing.
You shall name now which you choose, ‘heads’ or ‘tails.’”</p>

<p>Toss up the penny, and while attention is occupied with this,
and he is looking to see which is uppermost, heads or tails, you
withdraw your left hand from behind you, holding the little animal
you have concealed, and slipping it into the hat, and turning
the hat down over it, exclaim, “Stay, I mean to pass the
penny through the hat upon the table, and the whole affair shall
be settled by the result of the present toss. You shall see the
heads or tails on the table.”</p>

<p>By Pass 1, pretend to place the penny on the hat, but retain
it in your right hand. Say, “Fly, pass, and quickly.” Lift the
hat, and show both head and tail on the little animal or pet
there concealed.</p>

<p>If you should have had a Guinea pig, you must make the
guesses go on till your adversary guesses “tails,” and then it
will make a good laugh to say, “He has won, and he had better
now take it up by the tail.”</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_13"></a>TRICK 13.—To cook pancakes or a flat plum cake
in a hat, over some candles.</h3>

<p class="subt">REQUISITE PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have two gallipots or earthen jars, of a size to go easily into
a hat, but of such dimensions that the one reversed will fit
closely over the other. Tie worsted or a strip of linen round
the smaller gallipot, so as to insure the larger one holding firmly
round the smaller one. Have ready some thin, fluent dough,
some sugar, and a few currants, enough for two or three pancakes
or a small plum cake; also a spoon to stir the ingredients
up.</p>

<p>Have at hand two or three warm pancakes that have just been
prepared by the cook for you, with the same ingredients as mentioned
above. Let them be firm and free from grease. Have
also at hand two small plates, with knives and forks.</p>

<p>Commence the exhibition by borrowing two hats, to give you
a choice with which to perform. You can remark that as you
should be sorry to injure your friend’s hat, you will secure it
from being soiled by placing some paper in it as a lining. Hold
up the paper to show it is only paper, and then openly place it
in the hat, and lay the hat down on its side on the table near
you, having the brim towards you.</p>

<p>Have the ready-prepared pancakes lying near you, and whilst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
taking off the attention of the spectators by pretending to arrange
the articles on your table, slip the prepared pancakes or
plum-cake into the hat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></div>
</div>
<p>Unobserved, also place the smaller gallipot in the hat, and
while doing so, if requisite, add some remark, such as: “Please
to shut, or open, that door,” or any words that will draw off the
attention of the spectators from what you are doing. You must
next, with some parade, mix the fluent dough with the sugar
and currants in the larger gallipot. It must be fluent enough to
pour out slowly, apparently into the hat, but really into the
smaller gallipot, which has been already concealed inside the
hat. Show you have emptied the larger gallipot, all but a little;
then, placing it over the smaller gallipot again, empty the very
last of it, and press the larger gallipot firmly down over the
smaller one. Then, with it, lift the smaller gallipot also, with
its contents, while you appear only to take back the larger gallipot.
Remove the gallipots, as supposed to be empty, out of
sight. “Now, ladies and gentlemen, I must request your patience
a few minutes for the process of cooking.” Put two or
three candles near one another, and move the hat at a safe distance
above them for two or three minutes, making in the meantime
any laughable remarks that may occur to you, such as:
“My young friends will find this capital way of supplying
themselves with a delicate dish when they have lost their puddings
from being in the black books of their teacher or parents,”
or any similar humorous remark; but take care not to burn the
hat whilst the (supposed) cooking is going on. After a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
interval, place the hat on the table, and with some little ceremony
take out the real pancakes or plum-cake. Let it be cut
up and handed round to the juveniles who may be present.</p>

<p class="subt">REMARKS.</p>

<p>A more finished or surer arrangement for holding the dough,
etc., can be made with a tin apparatus, which can be prepared
by any tinman, upon the same principle as the gallipots, taking
care not to have it made larger than the inside of a youth’s
hat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></div>
</div>

<p>An amateur can render a common table more suitable for concealing
any little object he wishes to have secreted, by placing
three or four tumblers under each end of a plank, about the
length to extend across the table, and throwing any common
cloth over the board and table, or a kitchen table, covered with
a cloth, having a drawer pulled out about six inches, will furnish
a very good conjuror’s table. It is well to have the table rather
broad, so as to keep the spectators at a sufficient distance.</p>




<h3><a id="TRICK_14"></a>TRICK 14.—TO EAT A DISH OF PAPER SHAVINGS,
AND DRAW THEM OUT OF YOUR MOUTH LIKE AN
ATLANTIC CABLE.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Procure three or four yards of the thinnest tissue paper of various
colors. Cut these up in strips of half an inch or three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>-quarters
of an inch breadth, and join them. They will form a
continuous strip of many feet in length. Roll this up carefully
in a flat coil, as ribbons are rolled up. Let it make a coil about
as large as the top of an egg-cup or an old-fashioned hunting-watch.
Leave out of the innermost coil about an inch or more
of that end of the paper, so that you can easily commence unwinding
it from the centre of the coil.</p>

<p>Procure a large dish or basketful of paper-shavings, which can
be obtained at little cost from any bookbinder’s or stationer’s.
Shaken out it will appear to be a large quantity. As you wish it
to appear that you have eaten a good portion of them, you can
squeeze the remainder close together, and then there will appear
to be few left, and that your appetite has reason to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Commence the trick by proclaiming you have a voracious appetite,
so that you can make a meal off paper-shavings. Bend
down over the plate, and take up handful after handful, pretend
to munch them in your mouth, and make a face as if swallowing
them, and as you take up another handful, put out those previously
in your mouth, and put them aside. Having gone on with
this as long as the spectators seem amused by it, at last, with
your left hand, slip the prepared ball of tissue paper into your
mouth, managing to place towards your teeth the end you wish
to catch hold of with your right hand, for pulling the strip out
from your mouth. You will take care also not to open your
teeth too widely, lest the whole coil or ball should come out all
at once.</p>

<p>Having got hold of the end, draw it slowly and gently forward.
It will unroll to a length of twenty yards or more in a continuous
strip, much to the amusement of the spectators.</p>

<p>When it has come to the end, you may remark: “I suppose
we have come to a fault, as there is a ‘solution of continuity
here, just as the strongest cables break off,’ so we must wait to
pick up the end again, and go on next year, when the Great
Eastern again goes out with its next Atlantic Cable.”</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_15"></a>TRICK 15.—How to cut off a nose—of course without
actual injury.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have ready a piece of calico of light color, or a white apron,
a sponge saturated with a little liquid of the color of blood—port-wine,
or the juice of beet-root, will do; also two knives,
resembling each other, the one of them whole, the other with a
large notch in its blade, so that when placed over the nose it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
appear to have cut through the bridge of the nose. A cutler
could supply such knives, or they may be purchased at the depots
for conjuring apparatus.</p>

<p>Having placed out these articles on your table with seriousness
and imposing formality, show to the audience the knife that
is whole, and call upon them to observe that it is sufficiently
strong and sharp. The other knife must be placed somewhere
near you, but where it is sheltered from the observation of the
spectators.</p>

<p>Ask some young friend to step forward, assuring him that you
will not hurt him. Make him sit down on a chair facing the audience.
After having measured the real knife across his nose,
say: “But I may as well protect your clothes from being soiled,
so I will put an apron round your neck.” Go to the table to take
up the apron, and, in doing so, place down the real knife where
it cannot be seen, and, with your left hand take up the conjuror’s
knife, holding it by the blade, lest any one should observe the
notch in it. Conceal at the same time also, in your left hand,
the piece of sponge.</p>

<p>Advancing to the chair, tuck, with your right hand, the apron
round the youth’s neck. Then press the conjuror’s knife firmly
over the nose and leave it there, as if you had cut into the bridge
of the nose. At the same time gently squeeze the sponge, and
a little of the liquid will make an alarming appearance on the
face and on the apron; go on for a short time, covering the face
and apron with (apparent) blood. When the audience have seen
it long enough, seize up the apron, wipe the face of the youth
quite clean, throw away the conjuror’s knife, and exhibit your
young friend to the audience all right, and dismiss him with
some facetious remark on his courage in undergoing the alarming
operation.</p>

<small>TRICKS BY MAGNETISM, CHEMISTRY, GALVANISM, OR ELECTRICITY.</small></h2>


<p>There is a class of tricks about which I must say a few
words, viz., those that require to be exhibited by the help
of magnetism, chemistry, galvanism, or electricity. I need not
dwell long on them, for I do not consider them such as the
young people, for whom these notes are written, can be recommended
to devote their attention to, for the following reasons:
in the first place, they are, with a few exceptions, attended with
considerable expense. Secondly, the tricks connected with the
powerful agencies of galvanism and electricity are dangerous to
the unskilful operator; and, even in experienced hands, the
most effective of them are uncertain things to manage; therefore
their effect cannot be depended on.</p>

<p>Some very interesting tricks have, doubtless, at times been
exhibited by the help of galvanism and electricity. We have
read of a conjuror by such help confounding a powerful Arab, by
first letting him lift with ease a box, and afterwards rendering it
impossible for him to raise it, when an electric current had, to
his dismay, paralyzed all his strength. It is evident that an experiment
of this kind could not be safely attempted by any but
a very experienced person. We read also of conjurors who have
surprised their audience by receiving them in a dimly-lit theatre,
and then firing off a pistol, (to startle the audience and cover
the real mode of operation,) they have by electricity lighted up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
one hundred lamps at once. This has proved very successful on
some occasions; but on others, notwithstanding the most careful
preparation and the greatest precaution, it has been found
that the apparatus would not act, and the impatient spectators
have visited the disappointing failure with their indignant murmurs.
Other conjurors have become so attached to electric experiments,
that they have proposed to regulate all the clocks of
a large district by electricity, or have amused themselves by
turning electric or galvanic currents to the door-handles of their
houses, so that unsuspecting strangers, on touching them, were
startled with electric shocks. There is also a trick for rendering
one portion of a portrait electric by a metal plate concealed under
it, and the spectators being invited to touch some part of the
picture, have, on touching the spots that were charged with
electricity, received a shock or powerful blow, as if the portrait
resented their touching it.</p>

<p>Having briefly given the character of this class of tricks, and
stated that they not only require expensive apparatus, but are
attended with danger to the inexperienced, there still remains
another serious objection, viz., that, like the experiments performed
by automaton figures or complicated machinery, they are
liable to fail, through any trifling disarrangement, just at the moment
when the performer is hoping that his audience will be delighted
with his surprising exhibition.</p>

<p>For these reasons I shall not stay to describe the more elaborate
of these tricks, as, however interesting they may be to the
scientific, they would not, in a youthful amateur’s hands, be sure
to produce the amusement which it is my primary object to supply.</p>

<p>The simpler experiments of magnetism and chemistry may
well be regarded as recreations of science, interesting curiosities,
suitable enough to be exhibited by a professor of chemistry
for amusement and instruction; but even these can hardly be
considered as belonging to “conjuring proper.” Young people
do not care, at festive parties, to watch red liquids turning into
green, blue, and yellow; or the mixture of different chemical
ingredients producing strange conversions into varied substances;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
nor will experiments that are interesting as chemical curiosities
produce the same excitement and pleasing surprise that the
wonders of sleight-of-hand do. In a word, such experiments in
a private circle of young friends fail to constitute the most amusing
kind of parlor magic, while upon a public stage they are too
minute for any large audience to trace and comprehend.</p>

<p>Lest, however, my young readers should think that I have any
desire to shut them out from any field of reasonable pleasure, I
will now carefully select one or two examples of tricks connected
with the sciences of magnetism and chemistry, and which may,
even in the hands of amateurs, produce a safe and pleasing exhibition.</p>

<p>In the following trick they will find an amusing instance of the
combination of science with rational recreation.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_16"></a>TRICK 16.—The watch obedient to the word of command.</h3>

<p>The magnet is a well-known agent in producing several toys
for the entertainment of the young, and though its attraction is
wonderful, there is no danger likely to arise from employing it,
in the same way as might arise from unskilful dabbling with
electricity, galvanism, or chemical powers, and a strange and
singular effect may be produced by placing a magnet of some
little strength near a watch.</p>

<p>Supposing the young conjuror to have provided himself with
a powerful but not very large magnet, let him conceal it in the
palm, or under a thin glove in his left hand, or near the edge of
the cuff of his sleeve. Let him then borrow a lady’s watch,
(without chain,) and the thinner the watch-case is, and if it has
a glass, the better. Let him then call forward a youth, and placing
the watch in his own right hand, and near to the ear of the
other, ask him if he hears it going: he will answer “Yes.”</p>

<p>Let him next bid the watch to stop; and on taking it in his
left hand, where the magnet is concealed, it will stop, if held
steadily; and on inquiring of his young friend whether he can
hear it, he will reply “No.”</p>

<p>Observe: you must keep systematically to using your right
hand when you wish to make the watch go on, and to your left
when you wish it to stop. Appealing to others among the company,
the performer may then tell the watch to go on, and holding
it in his right hand, and giving it a slight shake, apply it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
one of their ears; it will be heard “tic, tic;” then holding it in
his left hand and telling it to stop, they will also find that it does
stop. You can pretend to doubt whether they are all deaf of
one ear, but lastly may declare that this is caused by the obedient
disposition of the watch, which so orderly obeys your command.
Remind your audience that savages upon first seeing a
watch believe it to be a living animal with power to think and
act of itself. “At any rate,” you may conclude, “the present
watch seems to hear, to understand, and to obey my orders.”</p>

<p>It will be an amusing addition to the above trick to say that
you will now order the watch to fly away and conceal itself.</p>

<p>You must for this purpose have provided yourself with an
electro-plated locket resembling a lady’s watch, and have two
loaves ready in some convenient corner.</p>

<p>When the watch has finished its “manual and platoon” exercise
on the platform, you may say, “I will now place this watch
visibly to all upon the table.” Turn round to go to your table,
and in walking to it, substitute the locket for the watch, and
place the locket on some spot visible to all. It will not be distinguishable
from the watch by the spectators at six or eight
yards’ distance from them. Conceal the watch itself in the palm
of your hand. You can now exclaim, “I require two loaves,”
and walking towards them, slip the watch into the one you have
prepared with a slit in its side. Advancing to the audience, ask
in which loaf they will prefer that you shall bid the watch fly.
If they name the one in which you have concealed it, proceed to
break open the loaf and find the watch. But suppose they name
the wrong one: you then, remembering that the left hand of the
spectators is your right hand, proceed with the true loaf, whichever
they have named, or manage to cross the position of the
loaves as you place them on the table.</p>

<p>Then taking up the locket with your right hand, make Pass 1,
as if transferring it to your left hand, but really retaining it in
your right hand (as described in my first paper.) Blow upon
your closed left hand, and say, “Watch, fly into that loaf.” Clap
your hands. It is gone.</p>

<p>Advancing to the loaf, get rid of the locket from your right
hand; take up the loaf, break it open on the other side from that
in which the locket was introduced, bring out the watch, and appeal
to the lady to declare whether it is the same which she lent
to you.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_17"></a>TRICK 17.</h3>

<p>An experiment with a very mild dash of electricity in it, which
will at any rate be a popular trick with most people that try it.
It will do for a small entertainment, or at any joyous party of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
young people. It does not, however, require a large number to
be present, but, contrary to the usual scientific tricks, its development
comes off better with one companion than with a dozen.</p>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>You must induce your cousin Jemima, or some other young
lady who is just of age to have cut her eye-teeth, to consent to
help you by accompanying you to a room with closed shutters
and no candles. A moderate-sized looking-glass must be on the
table, the smaller the better, for reasons below assigned. Have
ready at hand some ounces of hard candy.</p>

<p>You commence the trick by placing yourselves, hand-in-hand,
before the looking glass. If it is rather small, your heads will
be the closer—in order to see the reflection of both at once.
Then, with mouths as open as may be, try which of you can
crush his or her share of sugar-candy with the teeth the quickest.
In the glass will appear the reflection of sparks of electricity,
as the experiment proceeds. If your companion is nervous,
you can of course support her with one arm—ladies are
sometimes susceptible, whether from animal magnetism or what
not. The electric sparks coming between the lips may also be
attractive, and you may be tempted to try whether the electricity
evaporates the sweetness; but of course you must not be tempted
to forget the philosophical nature of the experiment; and, if you
behave with propriety, the lady will doubtless, on her return to
the company, tell them, in a staid manner, that the experiment
was all right; and perhaps when you see her, even a day or two
afterwards, you will observe there is an arch dimple on her cheek
and an electric sparkle lighting up her eye—and I should not
wonder if you should feel a desire to try the experiment over
again.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_18"></a>TRICK 18.—A chemical trick to follow one where a
young friend has assisted.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>You must have a wine-glass, a saucer, and a teaspoon, and
the chemical bottles No. 1 (silicate of potash) and No. 2 (aluminate
of potash,) which can be obtained from any druggist.</p>

<p>At the close of some trick in which any young friend has assisted,
you can say:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> “Well, my young friend, you have assisted
me so courteously and well that I must, in order to express my
thanks, ask you to take a glass of wine. Do you like wine?
Ah, I see by your smile you do.”</p>

<p>Pour out of bottle No. 1 half a glass, and, going towards him,
stop short and say: “Ah, but I am afraid your mamma would
be displeased with me if I gave you wine so strong without any
water, and I should be sorry to tempt you to drink what she
would disapprove. Stay, I will mix a little water with it.”</p>

<p>Mix some of No. 2 bottle, so as to fill the wine-glass, and say:
“Oh, never mind losing the pure wine; I dare say you will like
it very well as it is,” and make a few chatty remarks, to give the
liquids time to mingle their effects in the glass; and after a
minute or two say: “Ah! I’ll tell you what I am sure your
mamma would like still better—if I could give you some calves’-foot
jelly. Now, I really believe, if I were to stir it with this
teaspoon, and try my magic wand over it, I can turn it to jelly.
Let us try.” Occupy a little time while it is becoming like jelly,
and go on with a little more talk till you see that it has become
solid. Then say: “Well, after all, I will not deprive you of
your wine; so here it is. Please drink it.” Putting it to his
lips, he will find it has become so solid that he cannot drink it,
but it can be turned out quite solid into the saucer, and a general
laugh will greet him on the disappointment of his wine.</p>

<p>Having submitted a few remarks upon the class of tricks that
are to be performed by help of the sciences, magnetism, chemistry,
etc., and having stated my reasons for my not more fully
discussing them, I will now proceed to give an explanation of
one or two more that are better suited for the practice of amateurs.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_19"></a>TRICK 19.—To draw three spools off two tapes without
those spools having to come off the ends of the tapes,
and while the four ends of the tapes are held by four
persons.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>You must have two narrow tapes of about four feet long, bent
as in Fig. 11. Red tape I prefer.</p>

<p>You must next insert about half an inch of A through the loop
of B, and bring it back down on the other part of A.</p>

<p>A spool such as cotton is wound on, or an ornamented ball
with a hole drilled through it, just large enough to hold the tapes
lightly, will be required (Fig. 13.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 11, 12.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_045-1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_045-2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_045-3.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The spool or ball must be put on the tapes at the extreme ends
of the tape B, and drawn to the left, till it just covers the noose
at K. as in Fig. 14.</p>

<p>N. B.—All the above should be prepared before the spectators
are invited to witness the trick.</p>

<p>Commence the exhibition by calling upon the spectators to
observe that you hold a reel, or ball, through which two tapes
are passed.</p>

<p>You may then produce two more spools, or wooden balls, and
place one of them over the ends at A, and the other over the
ends at B.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_045-4.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following will then be the appearance of the balls or spools
and the tapes passed through them (Fig. 15):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>You may move about the spools 2 and 3, to show how the tape
runs through them, but you must not move spool 1.</p>

<p>You may then say that the puzzle is to get the spools off the
tapes while the four ends are held firmly in the hands of four
persons. Appoint four persons to hold them, and you may then
say: “To make doubly sure, I will tie one of the ends at A to
one of the ends at B with (the first half of) a knot.” It does
not signify which ends you take to do this, so that you take one
A and one B. “I will now pull these two ends so tight that it
will draw the three spools together, and also tighten all along one
side of them.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then, while four persons hold firmly the extreme ends of the
tapes, you must take shorter hold of the two A’s with your left
hand, (where it is marked by a dotted line, Fig. 16,) and also take
hold of the other tapes where a dotted line is marked on them
towards B. Then drawing your arms wider apart, so as to pull
the tapes steadily, the spools or balls will fall to the ground without
passing over the ends of the tapes.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_20"></a>TRICK 20.—To restore a tape whole after it has been
cut in the middle.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have five or six yards of tape about three-quarters of an inch
broad.</p>

<p>Take half the length in each hand. You will be able to show
the audience that you are about to cut it in the middle, by holding
it in two loops of equal length. Call their attention pointedly
to the equal division of the full length.</p>

<p>The tape will thus appear to the performer in the position
represented in Fig. 17.</p>

<p>Observe the tape A crosses at z the tape B on the side next to
the performer, whereas the tape D is to cross the tape y on the
side farthest from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>Fig. 18 represents the hands as they appear to the performer
himself, holding the tape with the thumb and forefinger at the
crossings of the tape at y and z, while the outward sides of each
loop are to be held by the three other fingers of each hand.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_047-1.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.<br />
Left Hand,</span><span class="i4">Right Hand.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_047-2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To proceed with the trick: Holding your hands in this position,
(Fig. 18,) you must request one of the spectators to cut
through the tape at x, but just as he is about to do so, you must
quickly lower your hands two or three inches, and then raise
them again. This movement will conceal the following operation.
You drop the part (B) of the tape held in your right
hand, and at the same moment pick up with that hand the other
tape marked C.</p>

<p>This will bring the portion of tape from C to D, so that it now
becomes the transverse tape, substituted in place of the tape
marked x, and your young friend will then cut it—instead of the
original tape marked x—without being aware that he is so
doing.</p>

<p>When the tape has been cut through, you can put your hands
near together, allowing the two ends of the little piece of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
tape—C D—to be seen, but concealing from the spectators
that you have hold of two pieces, one a very long one, and the
other only about five inches long. You can then say: “Now I
have to join these two ends, and to restore the tape
whole as at first.” You then turn the little piece C
D round the piece y, which is in your left hand, and
you tie a knot with the ends of that little piece.
You must not tie this knot very tight, and after you
have tied it, you drop the other end of the tape altogether
out of your right hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The appearance which the tapes will then have is
represented in Fig. 19. That is, you will seem to
hold the equally divided pieces of the long tape
joined in a knot at y, whereas in fact it is only the
small end piece C D, tied round the middle of the
long tape, which you hold between the thumb and
forefinger of the left hand. Exhibit the knot to the
company, and say: “I admit that this knot hardly
looks like a perfect restoration; I must employ my
best art to get rid of its unsightly appearance.”</p>

<p>Ask some one to hold, at about three yards’ distance,
the end marked with small d, retaining hold of
the centre—at y—in your left hand, which quite covers
the knot. Tell your friend to wind the tape round
his hand, and, while pretending to show him how to
do this, by winding the part which you hold round
your left hand, slide away towards your right the loose knot under
your right hand. Then, holding out the end of the tape A
towards another friend, to hold at about three yards’ distance to
the right, slip from off the long tape the little movable knot under
your right hand, just before he takes hold of this end of the
tape. Conceal in your right hand the little end-piece of tape,
until you can get rid of it into your pocket, or into any unobserved
spot. Blow upon your left hand, which is supposed still
to cover the knot, saying: “Knot, begone!—Restore!” Take
up your left hand, and show the tape to be free from any knot,
or join from one end of it to the other.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<small>ON THE CONTINUITY OF TRICKS.</small></h2>


<p>It may be useful now to invite attention to the theory of preserving
a continuity in the development of tricks, where
circumstances admit of this being done. Sundry displays of
legerdemain admit of being adroitly linked together; and I shall
endeavor to explain why such an harmonious continuity is preferable
to an unconnected series of isolated tricks; for when once
a novice gets a clear perception of this principle, he will be
able, according to his own special taste, to produce a pleasing
variety of combinations in his experiments. He will thus rise
above being a mere copyist of the methods used by others, and
so will give a zest and freshness to his performances.</p>

<p>Now, there are many short and secondary dashes of legerdemain,
which a spirited performer will be able to introduce in addition
to the tricks which he is exhibiting. There are also several
ornamental or fanciful little tricks which would not rivet the
attention of an audience if exhibited by themselves. These,
though unqualified to shine as the main object of observation,
may nevertheless be worked into the evening’s entertainment as
amusing by-play, and may thus prevent the interest of the spectators
from flagging. They may come in as accessories—as
stimulating side-dishes—causing the entertainment to bear a
continuous character, instead of merely consisting of sundry
isolated experiments.</p>

<p>Let me be allowed to substantiate what I have advanced by
reference to some of the tricks which I have already described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>The reader will have seen that, in some of the tricks explained
in previous papers, there is simply some one definite object to
be carried out. For instance, in the two tricks which concluded
the last paper, the performer simply undertakes to throw the
spools off the tape, or to restore a tape which has been cut. He
sets about this, accomplishes it, and the trick is over. This is
all very well as far as it goes. If the trick is really a good one,
it is like a host furnishing his guests with a solid joint to satisfy
their appetite; and it may do so. But still it comes short of a
lively entertainment. It is confessedly dull for an audience to
come to pauses or gaps between isolated tricks. Their attention
is unoccupied while the performer, having finished off one trick,
is making mute preparations to introduce some other trick
wholly unconnected with what has gone before. Such a method
will not keep awake the lively interest that the skilful combination
of the conjuror’s art will sustain. I maintain that varied
by-play and supplementary sets-off will greatly heighten the interest
of the performance.</p>

<p>It will also serve to disarm the suspicious and incredulous,
preparing them to believe what they might otherwise stand on
their guard against. Bare tricks brought forward as isolated experiments
give time for the mind to take its estimate of their
possibility; and, of course, in attempting to exhibit wonders,
the improbability of them is apt to stare people strongly in the
face. They are perfectly convinced that a dime cannot fly into
an orange at the other end of the room, that ink cannot become
water, nor a hat be safely used as a frying-pan; but if you interpose
appearances and movements that are consistent with such
processes going on, they are gradually prepared to recognize as
a legitimate result what you have previously indicated as the
contemplated end of those processes.</p>

<p>The amplification or fuller development which I speak of can
be effected at any of the following stages:</p>


<p class="hang">1. In the introductory matter leading on to the main trick or
transformation:</p>

<p class="hang">2. In the subsequent stages of its development; or,</p>

<p class="hang">3. In the winding-up smartly or variedly the conclusion of a
trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>I do not say that every trick is to be amplified or loaded with
extraneous matter in all these different stages, (that would be to
run into the contrary extreme of over-cumbrous amplification;)
but I will endeavor to point out the effect of such development
in the above three stages of a trick, and if I can show that amplification
in each several one may be an improvement, I may
be considered to have made good my proposition that any trick
may be improved and rendered more interesting by one or other
of those amplifications.</p>

<p>Let us see if we cannot lay down a bill of fare for our guests
which, going beyond a solid joint, (good as that may be in its
way,) will furnish them with some relishing accessory in the
first course of a trick, some stimulant side-dishes with its second
course, or may please with some bon-bons before the entertainment
is quite concluded.</p>


<p class="subt">1. INTRODUCTORY.</p>

<p>Now, first as to introductory matter. Suppose a conjuror is
able to perform Trick 3—the “Dancing Egg”—it will waken up
his audience if, instead of proceeding at once with the trick, he
can by sleight-of-hand find out an egg in the whiskers or necktie
of some unwatchful spectator, and afterwards substitute
for it the egg prepared with a hair and wax.</p>

<p>The chief aim of introductory matter should be to enlist the
thoughts and expectations of your audience under your command,
so as to preclude their watching what you are driving at.
Show all you can safely show openly; enlarge upon the things
being submitted to their own eyes and touch; engage their eyes
and ears with certain appearances leading their thoughts to
adopt your suggestions, so that, when you approach the development
intended, they have had no reason to suspect your motives;
thus having their confidence, you can jump at once to
their credulity, though there may, in fact, exist some gap, or illogical
process, which they omit to notice.</p>


<p class="subt">2. DURING THE SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF A TRICK.</p>

<p>I often vary and render more interesting the development of
a trick by some little by-play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>For instance, in the trick which I often use as my first trick I
make a candle an amusing helper, by snatching it from the candle-stick,
and asking some one to hold it wrapt up in paper.</p>

<p>And this unexpected service of the candle is wrought into the
body of the trick which I have in hand.</p>

<p>I change also a crystal ball into an orange by skilful manipulation.</p>

<p>By such brief diversion of the attention of the spectators,
their eyes are withdrawn from watching too narrowly some manœuvre
that is requisite to carry out the more important trick
which you have in hand.</p>

<p>Or you may actually make an act, which is a mere accessory,
cover some important portion of the trick; as in the tape trick
(No. 20.) While <span class="smcap">PRETENDING TO SHOW YOUR ASSISTANT HOW TO
HOLD</span> the tape in <span class="smcap">HIS</span> hand, you slip the knot away unperceived
wider <span class="smcap">YOUR OWN</span> hand.</p>


<p class="subt">3. IN CONCLUDING A TRICK.</p>

<p>It greatly adds to the efficiency of a trick to let it finish off
with a sparkle, or some playful addition which gilds its exit.</p>

<p>For instance, in the trick of doubling the pocket-money, (7th
trick,) the little by-play of finding, or rather pretending to
find, some coins secreted in the sleeve of the young friend who
has helped you, is sure to bring out a good-humored laugh at
the termination of the trick. Again, in Trick 16, the additional
fact of finding the watch in the loaf makes a lively termination
of the performance of the obedient watch. In the 18th Trick,
the glass of wine becoming solid might be used as a good finish
to any trick where some friend has assisted in its exhibition.</p>

<p>You may often raise a good-humored laugh by appearing to
swallow any object which you have used in a trick—as an orange,
ball, egg, or dime—and afterwards bringing it out from
your sleeve; or, by the use of Pass 1, to drive a coin up one
sleeve, round the back of your neck, and down the other sleeve,
into your right hand.</p>

<p>I not only consider such Amplifications of a trick lively and
interesting, but I maintain this to be the best way of employing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
many secondary and short tricks wherever they can be brought
in appropriately as offshoots of longer and more important
ones.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_21"></a>TRICK 21.—The invisible hen: a very useful trick for
supplying eggs for breakfast or dinner.</h3>


<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Position 1.<span class="i8">Position 2.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In order to save the invisible hen trouble and delay, it will be
advisable to have eight or ten egg-shells, (as described in Trick
3;) or some light imitation eggs, painted white, may be bought
at any depot of conjuring apparatus. A linen or camlet bag
may also be procured from the same depot, though I think a bag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
made at home, according to the following directions, to be preferable.</p>

<p>It must be about the size of a small pillow, two feet three
inches across, and one foot nine inches deep. It has one of its
sides of double cloth, (x,) the other single, (z,) in the same way
as leather writing-cases have a pocket on one side, and a single
cover on the other. The double side is stitched together all
round, with the exception of an opening at A, which must be
about five inches long, or large enough to admit easily a hand to
put in or take out the eggs. This double side of the bag must
always be kept towards the performer, whereas the single side
must be always kept towards the spectators; and the only opening
between these two sides is between C and D. On the interior
of the side of the double cloth bag, a strip or kind of frill
of the same cloth must be sewn, with an elastic binding round
the pockets or cups for eggs. The elastic binding will keep them
in these pockets, unless they are pressed by the thumb or finger,
so as to release them and let them fall into the centre of the
double bag. The strip has the appearance of a string of inverted
egg-cups, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The position of it in the bag is indicated in Fig. 21 by the
dots running across the bag; but the strip itself is never seen
by the spectators, for it is placed on the inner side of the double
bag, which is always towards the performer.</p>

<p>Having carefully prepared the above apparatus, commence the
exhibition of the trick by holding up the bag by the corners C
and D, as represented in Fig. 21. Shake the bag well while so
holding it, showing it to be (apparently) empty.</p>

<p>After having thus exhibited the bag, thrust both your hands
down inside it to the corners A and B. Holding those corners,
pull the bag inside out, and again show it to be empty, in this
reversed position, represented in Fig. 21.</p>

<p>As the spectators have now seen it thoroughly, inside and outside,
you may put the question to them, “whether they admit
it to be empty, as they ought to know.”</p>

<p>While holding the bag by the same corners A and B, you
must now gather the bag a little closer together, and holding it
well up—see Fig. 21—press with your thumb one of the eggs out
of its elastic cup. This can be easily done without any one observing
the movement. This egg, with a little gentle shaking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
will fall into the large bag made by the double side; but it cannot
fall to the ground, however much you shake it, for there is
no opening but at A, and that is upwards towards your right
hand, so you may shake the bag boldly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></div>
<div class="caption">Position 3.<span class="i8">Position 4.</span></div>
</div>

<p>You next lower the bag a little, and spread it on your chest,
letting it rest there while you move your hands from A and B
to take hold of the corners C and D; and you must give an
opening for what had hitherto been the higher part of the bag,
to drop through between the opening that there is between C
and D. This will keep the double side of the bag (x) still towards
yourself, and the bag will now be returned to its original
position (Fig. 21.) With your left hand retaining hold of the
corner D, and lowering the bag towards your right hand, shake
well the loosened egg down towards the corner A. Search with
your right hand about that corner, and the opening of the double
bag, and you will be able to bring out the egg that had been
loosened while the bag was in position 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Take out that egg; shake the bag well, as if it were quite
empty: and then, thrusting both your hands into the interior
corners at A and B, turn the bag inside out; bring it to position
2, ready to re-commence bringing out the other eggs one by one,
as long as the spectators are interested. While you hold the bag
in position 2, you can safely let any young person feel to the
bottom of the bag, as he will not be likely to suspect the eggs
are towards the top of the bag on the side near to yourself.</p>

<p>The same bag may be used also much to the amusement of
children, by your loading it with walnuts, chestnuts, small apples,
or pears, or any bon-bon of about the size of an egg; and
then allowing the children, one by one, to feel in your lucky bag
for what you take care they shall find in their successive
searches.</p>


<h3>A SERIES OF TRICKS, 22, 23, 24.—The chief agent
being a plain gold ring.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>You must be provided with a small thin wire pointed at both
ends, which, being bent round, will resemble an ordinary plain
gold ring.</p>

<p>You must also have on your table an orange or a lemon, a box
or bowl, a tumbler, and a dessert-knife.</p>

<p>And you must have four or five needlefuls of thick cotton,
which have been previously steeped for about an hour in a wine-glass
of water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it; and have been
afterwards completely dried, so as to burn easily.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_22"></a>TRICK 22.</h3>

<p>Having the fictitious ring in the palm of your hand, commence
by requesting any lady present to oblige you by lending
you a plain gold ring, and borrow also from some gentleman a
colored silk handkerchief. Appear to place the borrowed ring in
that handkerchief, but in reality place in it the rounded fictitious
ring. Doubling the centre of the handkerchief round it,
request some gentleman to hold it, so as to be sure he has got
the ring in the handkerchief—while you fetch a slight cord to
fasten it. While going to your table to fetch this cord, you slip
the real ring into a slit in the orange which you had prepared,
and which closes readily over it. You then tie the cord round
the handkerchief, about two inches from the ring, and, calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
the spectators to notice how it is secured, take hold of that part
of the handkerchief which incloses the fictitious ring in your
own hand, and tell the gentleman to place one by one the four
corners of the handkerchief over your hand. Directly he has
begun to do this, your fingers must proceed to unbend and open
the fictitious ring, and to press it by its pointed end through the
silk, and conceal it in your own palm. You tell your assistant
to blow upon the handkerchief and open it—the ring is gone,
and you return the handkerchief to the owner. Fetch the orange
from your table, and ask some one to cut it open, and he
will find the lady’s ring in the centre of the orange.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_23"></a>TRICK 23.</h3>

<p>You are now to proceed immediately to the next development
of the mysterious powers of the plain ring, which ladies so much
admire. You may commence by remarking that “you have little
doubt that this symbol of love and obedience will at your
command pass through the table, solid as it is. Let us try.”</p>

<p>Place the tumbler on the table—produce your own silk handkerchief,
to the centre of which a plain ring is already fastened
by a doubled silk thread of about 4 inches length.</p>

<p>Use Pass 1 with the real ring, as if passing it into the handkerchief:
conceal that ring, and substitute for it the fictitious
ring.</p>

<p>Then addressing the spectators, say:</p>

<p>“Now, ladies and gentlemen, I will drop this ring into the
glass, so as you shall hear it fall.” Do so. Let the handkerchief
rest over the glass for a minute or two. “Now I must
place this bowl under the table to receive the ring.” In so placing
the bowl, you must silently place the real ring in it. Then
say aloud, “Change, ring; pass from the glass through the table
into the bowl below.” Lift up the handkerchief, and while
inviting one or two to come and examine the glass and the bowl,
smooth your forehead with the handkerchief as if heated, and
pass it into your pocket. Your young friends will be astonished
to find the ring not in the glass, where they heard it tinkle, but
in the bowl underneath the table.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_24"></a>TRICK 24.</h3>

<p>“Now, ring, you have amused us so well, that you shall, like
Mahomet, be sustained in the air without visible support.”</p>

<p>Place over a common walking-stick some of your prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
cotton threads, having twisted two or three of them together,
and united them in a loop, which you draw through the ring, and
then slip the ring through the end of the loop. The ring will
then hang suspended about a foot below the stick. The stick
itself may be steadily fixed, resting on the back of two chairs at
an elevation, so as to be easily seen by the company.</p>

<p>When the ring has been thus suspended, set fire to the cotton
about two inches above the ring; the flame will run upwards towards
the stick; blow it out when about two inches from the
stick, and the ring will remain pendulous in the air for some little
time after the cotton has been burnt.</p>

<p>The suspension is said to be caused by a filament, or fine thread
of glass—which has been formed by the ashes of the cotton uniting
with the heated salt, with which the cotton had been prepared.</p>

<p>Now this trick would be too simple an experiment to be exhibited
by itself; but coming as a finish to two other tricks, which
have been performed with the same ring, the spectators</p>

<p>
Will give it honor due.<br />
</p>

<p>I trust that I have satisfactorily established the assertion that
a combination of congenial tricks will often tell more effectively
than the same tricks would if exhibited without such combination.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<small>FRIENDLY SUGGESTIONS.</small></h2>


<p>As the amateur will aspire to come before his parlor audience
some day or other, it may be some little service and help
to him to give a few suggestions as to the best way of conducting
such an exhibition, and to specify the kind of tricks to which he
will do well to limit himself. It will be desirable to open with
an off-hand expression of his wish to place before them a few
amusing tricks to wile away an hour; and let him assume a
lively air, for his own liveliness will sustain that of the spectators.</p>

<p>There are some conjurors who, though they can perform good
tricks, exhibit them in such a heavy, uninteresting way that they
create no enthusiasm. An over-anxious look, coupled with a
creeping, fearful movement, and a dull, monotonous voice, will
suggest distrust and dissatisfaction, even where the audience has
come together prepossessed with the expectation of mirth and
glee. Let none assume, then, to wave the conjuror’s wand till
he has himself some confidence in his powers, knows what he
purposes to do, and means to carry it out. I would say that a
moderate degree of assumption, a gay vivacity, ready to break
out into a smile, a cheerful spirit, and a joyous voice, will go a
great way to bespeak favor, which the performer can quickly repay
by dashing off his tricks with enthusiasm. The language
used by the conjurer should be studiously guarded. Let there
be no vain-glorious assertions, no self-praise, but respectful deference
to the judgment of the spectators; rather inclining to
give them the credit of understanding more than they do, than
twitting them with understanding less. Be neither overbearing
with conceited “chaff” upon any of the company; nor, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
other hand, venture upon extreme and disconcerting compliments
to any person present. Rather, as a courteous master of
the ceremonies, conduct the experiments with a simple effort to
please and to amuse all. With the exhibition of an amateur,
the performance of some lively airs upon the piano by any friend
will form an agreeable accompaniment, especially if the spirited
and humorous melodies are introduced, which the public taste
recognizes as the tunes of the day. You will do well to have
your table neatly and carefully arranged. Let it not lie too near
to the spectators, nor within reach of too minute inspection.
It should be of sufficient height to show the main objects placed
on it; but the surface of it may be just high enough to be sheltered
from the spectators clearly viewing every article upon it.
The ornaments should be few, yet, at the same time, be serviceable
to shade a few articles which it may be policy to conceal.</p>

<p>1. The centre table may be a moderate-sized kitchen table,
with a drawer to stand open; so that the performer can take any
article out of the drawer with one hand, while engaging the eyes
of the spectators with his other hand. A colored cloth should
be over the tables, on the side towards the spectators.</p>

<p>2. Two small tables, at the sides of the centre table, may also
be useful, as in Fig. 23.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">FIG.</span> 23.</div>
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>3. With tables arranged somewhat in this manner, the amateur
will be able to take up articles, from either the surface or
back of the tables, without attracting notice to his doing so.
He must practise taking up things with one hand, while his other
hand and his eyes are ostensibly occupied with some other object;
for if the spectators see him looking behind his table, their
eyes will immediately follow in the same direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>The amateur will do well to select the simpler tricks for his
first attempts, and never pretend to exhibit even those without
having frequently and diligently practised them. He must make
up his resolution to train his hands to the passes, and to the
several manœuvres in the tricks, as diligently as young ladies
train their fingers to the keys of the piano.</p>

<p>And let them not be discouraged if they feel awkward and
nervous at first. Some of the best conjurors have candidly confessed
their early failings and misgivings. With practice and
perseverance this will, in most cases, wear off. I would augur
that, if they feel an interest in the art, and a desire to excel in
it, they will most probably secure a measure of success that will
amply repay their efforts.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_25">TRICK 25.—The Conjuror’s “Bonus Genius,” or Familiar
Messenger.</a></h3>

<p>This is an old trick that has delighted thousands, and may
amuse thousands more, if adroitly performed. There are only
the simplest mechanical arrangements connected with it; its
successful exhibition depends upon the dexterity and vivacity of
the performer.</p>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>You must have a strong wooden doll, about eight or ten inches
high; the head must fix on or off by a peg at the bottom of the
throat, being placed in a hole made at the top of the bust. Besides
a close-fitting dress to its body, a large, loose, fantastic
cloak must be placed round the whole figure, but must be so arranged
as to allow the head to be pushed down through the part
of the cloak that covers the bust, and an elastic pocket must be
neatly made inside the cloak to receive and retain the head.</p>

<p>Having the above apparatus ready, you may commence by
saying:</p>

<p>“Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to introduce my learned
friend and assistant—indefatigable in traveling to the most distant
parts on any message I may wish to send him. He used to
be recognized by early conjurors as their Bonus Genius—their
good familiar spirit. But, whatever his special title, he is gifted
with the art of rendering himself visible or invisible, as he feels
disposed, while he travels to distant countries.</p>

<p>“Allow me to call your attention to the solid frame and unflinching
nerves, at any rate to the well-seasoned constitution of
my friend. [Rap him loudly, rap, rap, rap, on the table.] The
raps he received during his education doubtless accustomed him
to bear much without flinching. Though his travels have ranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
from China to Peru, from the Equator to the Poles, you perceive
he still sounds like a hardy Pole himself. (Rap, rap,
rap.)</p>

<p>“I perceive, however, by the glaring of his eye, that, after
my too rough handling, he is desirous of starting on his travels.
I suppose we must provide him with the needful for his expenses.
Large sums are given now-a-days to special correspondents
in foreign countries; who will kindly give him sufficient?
He will want a golden or silver key to open some curiosities
he may wish to inspect in foreign cities. (Pause.) Oh,
well, as there is a delay about it, I must myself supply him. I
think I have a few disposable coins in my pocket: he shall have
them.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, while your left hand holds the
upper part of the cloak near the neck, so as to cover what you
are doing, you withdraw the wooden body with your right hand,
while you move your right hand down to your pocket for the
coins. You then leave the body of the doll in your pocket, and
taking out the coins, present them to the head and cloak of the
figure, which is held in your left hand, saying: “There, my
good friend, you can now, if you wish, proceed on your tour to
Algiers, or Dahomey, or Timbuctoo, or wherever the universal
Yankee travelers fancy at the present to resort.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see he is pleased and in good spirits again. He
wishes apparently to bid you good-bye. You will excuse his
looking also round about him, to judge whether the weather is
fair to set out; after which I will lay my hand on his head to express
my good wishes for his journey. I dare say he will not
stay much longer after that than a schoolboy does after his master
has bid him good-bye.”</p>

<p>Place with formal ceremony your hand on his head, press it
down through the opening below it, receive it in your left hand
underneath the cloak, and bestow it safely in the pocket.</p>

<p>Affect astonishment at finding the gown alone left in your
hands, and fold it up with a lamentation at his departure. You
may say: “It is clear that he has chosen to go to a hot climate,
as he has left his cloak behind him.”</p>

<p>Discourse for a few minutes about sending a telegram to overtake
him at London or San Francisco—talk about the sea-passage,
railways, tunnels, and what not.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I need none of these if I wish him back. I can
summon him again by a few mystic wavings of my wand and by
secret art. Hey, my friend, I need thy presence; quick, return,
I pray you. I wish to see you again in your familiar
garb—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">By the pricking of my thumbs,</div>
<div class="verse">Something ghostly hither comes.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>
<p>Swell out the cloak with your left hand, and at the same time
thrust up the head from the pocket. It will appear as if the
whole figure stood before them.</p>

<p>Then say: “I fear, dear friend, I have trespassed by abridging
your tour. You can hardly have traversed Algeria, crossed the
mountains of the moon, or found the birthplace of the Nile; and
no one returns now-a-days without some such marvel to relate.
I will let you depart again. As some people say to troublesome
visitors: ‘You may depart now; please to call again to-morrow.’”</p>

<p>Repeat the manœuvre, as before, of secreting the head. Then
exclaim: “Alas! he is gone in earnest, like the sojourner of a
day (with mock pathos.) When we have lost him, we feel our
loneliness.”</p>

<p>Fold up sorrowfully the cloak of the departed, and so conclude
the trick.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_26"></a>TRICK 26.—The Shower of Money.</h3>

<p>A dozen silver coins, or pennies, will be equally useful in exhibiting
this trick; but some fictitious coin, in color resembling
gold, will perhaps more effectively delight those who are charmed
by the yellow glitter of the precious metal. The performer must
have provided himself with so many of these in his left hand as
he purposes to produce at the end of the trick, and two of the
same coin also must be concealed in his right palm. He must
further borrow a hat from one of the company.</p>

<p>The imagination of the spectators having been excited by the
expectation of beholding a shower of money, the adept in sleight-of-hand,
keeping one of the two coins in his right hand concealed,
must advance the other coin to the end of his forefinger
and thumb, while he pretends to pick a coin out of the candle,
or of the rim of a hat, or from a lady’s fan or shoulder, or may
pretend to clutch a coin floating in the air. As he brings away
his prize, he may rattle it against the other coin concealed in his
right hand. Then, making Pass 1, he may pretend to pass it
into the hat, being careful precisely at the same moment to drop,
audibly, a coin from his left hand into the hat which he holds in
that hand. Let him tell the audience to keep count how many
he collects: it will rather distract their attention.</p>

<p>He can continue this pleasant appearance of acquiring wealth
for ten minutes, or as long as he can devise various methods of
appearing to clutch it, till the number with which he stored his
left hand is exhausted.</p>

<p>He may then request some one to count out, audibly, into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
plate the coins collected in the hat, which will coincide with the
number he has appeared to collect so magically from various
sources. When adroitly done, this trick is very pleasing and effective.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_27"></a>TRICK 27.—To Furnish Ladies With a Magic Supply of
Tea or Coffee, at their selection, From One and the
Same Jug.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have a metal jug to hold not less than three pints. It must
be constructed with two compartments in the lower part of it,
holding about a pint and a quarter each, and these must each
have a pipe connected with the spout of the jug and another
pipe connecting with its handle, and in the handle a small hole
about the size of a letter—o—in this print. These lower compartments
must be filled with good tea and coffee before the jug
is produced.</p>

<p>The upper chamber or compartment, like the upper portion of
a patent coffee-pot, must have no communication with the lower
divisions, and must be well closed also at the top with a tin cover,
closely fitting. Have half a dozen small tea-cups and half a
dozen small coffee-cups ready on a tray.</p>

<p>Begin the trick by placing openly in the upper compartment
coffee-berries and tea, mixing them together. Take up, as a
sudden thought, an old blacking bottle, and pretend to pour
from it into the jug, to furnish highly-colored liquid to improve
the coffee; and a little gunpowder, about a teaspoonful, may be
fired off over the mixture to make the tea strong. Wave your
wand over the jug.</p>

<p>Then you may address the ladies: inform them that the ingredients
are well mixed, and invite them to name which they will
prefer, “tea or coffee,” as you can produce either at their command
from the same jug.</p>

<p>Get some friend to hand the cups, while you follow him, and,
by unstopping the holes in the handle for admitting air upon the
coffee or tea, the one of them that each lady names will flow out
from the spout of this magic jug.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_28"></a>TRICK 28.—A Pleasing Exhibition for both the Performer
and the Audience to view when they feel a
little Exhausted.</h3>

<p class="subt">PREPARATION.</p>

<p>Have two pint bottles and one quart bottle; the pint bottles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
to be filled, one with a liquid resembling port, the other with
one resembling sherry; the large bottle to be at first empty.
Three opaque metal stands—the centre one to stand under the
quart bottle, to have a large cavity to hold a quart, and the upper
part of this stand to be full of large holes, like a cullender,
for the liquor to run from the opening at H into that cavity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_065-1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>You must also have three metal covers, of proper size to cover
the above three bottles—these covers to have handles at top, so
as to be easily lifted. The large centre cover is simply a cover;
but the two side ones, which are to cover the pint bottles, must
be made with metal cavities large enough to hold, one a pint of
port, the other a pint of sherry, at top, with a descending pipe
to fall into the mouths of the pint bottles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_065-2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There must be a small hole at top of each of the small covers,
at B and C, which hole, being covered with tinfoil, will, as long
as it is closed, prevent the wine from running out at D. But
when the tinfoil is scraped off, and the hole admits the air, the
wine will then be able to run into the pint bottles.</p>

<p>The above apparatus being all ready, commence by saying:
“I will now pour this pint of port and this pint of sherry into
the large bottle, mixing them inseparably together.” Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
done so, remove the stopper at bottom of the large bottle as you
place it on its stand, and immediately place the large cover over
it. The mixed liquid will gradually run out into the concealed
cavity in the stand.</p>

<p>You must now talk a little magic nonsense, to draw off the attention,
while you place the special covers over each of the
small bottles, so that the descending pipes in the covers fit in
the necks of the bottles. Remove the tinfoil with which you
had covered the holes at A and B.</p>

<p>With a few magic waves of your wand, and words of art, say:
“I shall now cause the mixed liquids in the centre bottle to appear
severally in their own original bottles.” Let the covers remain
a few seconds. Clap your hands, saying: “Change, begone!”
Lift the centre cover: the large bottle will be seen to
be empty. Lift successively the covers from the small bottles:
they will be seen to have each their proper wine—one port, the
other sherry.</p>


<h3><a id="TRICK_29">TRICK 29.—To Furnish a Treat to the Gentlemen.</a></h3>

<p>For this the magic bottle must be procured. One with three
or four compartments is amply sufficient. In these place gin,
sherry, and port wine, respectively. The bottle will have three
or four holes, on which you place your fingers as if stopping the
holes of a flute. You may have a bucket of water and a common
bottle, resembling the magic one in size and appearance,
near your table. Have ready also a tray of wine-glasses of thick
glass, and holding only a very small quantity.</p>

<p>Exhibit the common bottle to the audience, and then place it
on your table, and direct attention to some of the other articles
on your table. “Now I must begin my experiment. I will
wash and drain my bottle, that you may see the experiment from
the beginning to the end.” Place it in the bucket, and while
shaking it about, and letting the water run out, exchange it for
the magic bottle lying by the bucket. Wipe that carefully with
a napkin, as if drying it, and calling two or three of the audience
forward at a time, inquire which they prefer. Have the
stops according to alphabetical order to prevent your mistaking—gin,
port, sherry. Continue supplying the small glasses as
called for, till your bottle gets nearly empty, and then pour them
out indiscriminately. There will have been sufficient to satisfy
the most eager.</p>

<p>But if you wish to continue the trick, yen may have a second
magic bottle prepared in the same way, and you will easily, while
propounding some magic charm and gesticulating, make some
pretence that will enable you to exchange the empty for the second
bottle, and so proceed.</p>

<h2 id="VENTRILOQUISM_MADE_EASY">VENTRILOQUISM MADE EASY.</h2>


<h3>WHAT IS VENTRILOQUISM?</h3>

<p>Before we take the reader into the precise and minute instructions
which he will have to study and practice ere he can become
the possessor of the coveted art, it will be necessary to inform him
what Ventriloquism<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> is, and in what it consists. In doing so, we
shall endeavor to be as plain and clear as possible. Ventriloquism
may be divided into two sections, or general heads, the
first of which may be appropriately designated as Polyphonism,
and consists of the simple imitation of the voices of human
creatures, of animals, of musical instruments, and sounds and
noises of every description in which no illusion is intended, but
where, on the contrary, the imitation is avowedly executed by the
mimic, amongst which we may classify sawing, planing, door-creaking,
sounds of musical instruments, and other similar imitations.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1" class="label">1</a>
Literally signifying belly-speaking, from <i lang="la">venter</i>, the belly, and <i lang="la">loquor</i>, I
speak.</p></div>

<p>Secondly, we have ventriloquism proper, which consists in the
imitation of such voices,, sounds, and noises, not as originating in
him, but in some other appropriate source at a given or varying
distance, in any or even in several directions, either singly or together—a
process exciting both wonder and amusement, and
which may be accomplished by thousands who have hitherto
viewed the ventriloquist as invested with a power wholly denied
by nature to themselves. It is needless to observe, that when the
imitations are effected without a movement of mouth, features,
or body, the astonishment of the audience is considerably enhanced.</p>

<p>The terms polyphony, mimicry, or imitation, are employed
to designate results obtained in reference to the first division of
the subject, where no illusion is intended; while the term ventriloquism
distinguishes those under the second division, where
an illusion is palpably produced. The first is much more common
than the latter; indeed, there is scarcely a public school
which does not possess at least one boy capable of imitating the
mewing of a cat, the barking of a dog, or the squeaking voice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
an old woman. On the other hand, from a want of the knowledge
of <em>how</em> to proceed, it is very seldom that even a blundering
attempt at ventriloquism is heard, except from a public platform.</p>

<p>There have been many statements put forward defining ventriloquism,
but we are decidedly of opinion that the theory of two
of the most celebrated of foreign ventriloquists, Baron de Mengen
and M. St. Gille, who were sufficiently unselfish to avow the
secret of their art, is not only the most correct, but it is at once
the most reasonable and the most natural.</p>

<p>From Baron de Mengen’s account of himself, and the observations
made by M. de la Chapelle, in his frequent examinations of
St. Gille, whom we shall afterwards refer to, it seems that the
factitious ventriloquist voice does not (as the etymology of the
word imports) proceed from the belly, but is formed in the inner
parts of the mouth and throat.</p>

<p>The art does not depend on a particular structure or organization
of these parts, but may be acquired by almost any one ardently
desirous of attaining it, and determined to persevere in
repeated trials.</p>

<p>The judgments we form concerning the situation and distance
of bodies, by means of the senses mutually assisting and correcting
each other, seem to be entirely founded on experience; and
we pass from the sign to the thing signified by it immediately, or
at least without any intermediate steps perceptible to ourselves.</p>

<p>Hence it follows that if a man, though in the same room with
another, can by any peculiar modifications of the organs of
speech, produce a sound which, in faintness, tone, body, and
every other sensible quality, perfectly resembles a sound delivered
from the roof of an opposite house, the ear will naturally, without
examination, refer it to that situation and distance; the
sound which he hears being only a sign, which from infancy he
has become accustomed, by experience, to associate with the idea
of a person speaking from a house-top. A deception of this kind
is practised with success on the organ and other musical instruments.</p>

<p>Rolandus, in his “Aglossostomographia,” mentions, that if the
mediastinum, which is naturally a single membrane, be divided
into two parts, the speech will seem to come out of the breast, so
that the bystanders will fancy the person possessed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gough, in the “Manchester Memoirs,” vol. v. part ii. p.
622 London, 1802, investigates the method whereby men judge by
the ear of the position of sonorous bodies relative to their own
persons.</p>

<p>This author observes, in general that a sudden change in direction
of sound, our knowledge of which, he conceives, does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
depend on the impulse in the ear, but on other facts, will be perceived
when the original communication is interrupted, provided
there be a sensible echo. This circumstance will be acknowledged
by any person who has had occasion to walk along a valley,
intercepted with buildings, at the time that a peal of bells is ringing
in it. The sound of the bells, instead of arriving constantly at
the ears of the person so situated, is frequently reflected in a short
time from two or three different places. These deceptions are, in
many cases, so much diversified by the successive interpositions
of fresh objects, that the steeple appears, in the hearer’s judgment,
to perform the part of an expert ventriloquist on a theatre—the
extent of which is adapted to its own powers, and not to those of
the human voice.</p>

<p>The similarity of effect which connects this phenomenon with
ventriloquism, convinced the author, whenever he heard it, that
what we know to be the cause in one instance, is also the cause in
the other, viz., that the echo reaches the ear, while the original
sound is intercepted by accident in the case of the bells <em>but by
art</em>, in the case of the ventriloquist.</p>

<p>It is the business of the ventriloquist to amuse his admirers
with tricks resembling the foregoing delusion; and it will be readily
granted that he has a subtle sense, highly corrected by experience
to manage, on which account the judgment must be cheated
as well as the ear.</p>

<p>This can only be accomplished by making the pulses, constituting
his words strike the heads of his hearers, not in the right
lines that join their persons and his. He must therefore, know
how to disguise the true direction of his voice; because the artifice
will give him an opportunity to substitute almost any echo he
chooses in the place of it. But the superior part of the human body
has been already proved to form an extensive seat of sound, from
every point of which the pulses are repelled as if they diverge from
a common centre. This is the reason why people, who speak
in the usual way, cannot conceal the direction of their voices,
which in reality <em>fly off towards all points at the same instant</em>. The
ventriloquist, therefore, by some means or other, acquires the
difficult habit of <em>contracting</em> the field of sound within the <em>compass of
his lips</em>, which enables him to confine the real path of his voice to
narrow limits. For he who is master of his art has nothing to
do but to place his mouth obliquely to the company, and to
dart his words out of his mouth—if the expression may be used—whence
they will then strike the ears of the audience as that
from an unexpected quarter. Nature seems to fix no bounds to
this kind of deception, only care must be taken not to let the
path of the direct pulses pass too near the head of the person who
is played upon, but the divergency of the pulses make him perceive
the voice itself. Our readers will, therefore, not be sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>prised
that the French Academy adopted this view of the subject,
and laid down that the art consists in an <em>accurate imitation of any
given sound as it reaches the ear</em>. In conformity with a theory so
incontrovertible, physiologists have suggested a variety of
movements of the vocal organs to explain still further the originating
cause; and some have gone so far as to contend for a
peculiarity of structure in these organs as an essential requirement;
but they have wisely omitted to specify what. Nothing,
however, can be more accurate than the description of
“the <em>essence</em>” of ventriloquy in the “English Cyclopædia”—namely,
that it “<em>consists in creating illusions as to the distance and direction
whence a sound has travelled</em>.” How those sounds are produced,
we shall show in another chapter,</p>


<h3><a id="VENTRILOQUISM_AMONGST_THE_ANCIENTS"></a>VENTRILOQUISM AMONGST THE ANCIENTS.</h3>

<p>Charles Lamb gave utterance to the thought that it was
“pleasant to contemplate the head of the Ganges,” but the
student of ventriloquism finds it difficult to obtain a view of
the source of his art. In the dim and misty ages of antiquity,
he may trace under various guises the practice of it. Many of
the old superstitions were fostered by its means; from the cradle
of mankind to the birthplace of idolatry, we incidentally
learn of the belief in a familiar spirit—a second voice, which
afterwards took the form of divination.</p>

<p>The various kinds of divination amongst the nations of antiquity
which were stated by the priesthood to be by a spirit, a
familiar spirit, or a spirit of divination, are now supposed to have
been effected by means of ventriloquism. Divination by a familiar
spirit can be tracked through a long period of time. By
reference to Leviticus xx. 27 it will be seen that the Mosaic law
forbade the Hebrews to consult those having familiar spirits, and
to put to death the possessor. The Mosaic law was given about
fifteen hundred years before Christ. Divining by a familiar
spirit was, however, so familiar to the Jews, that the prophet
Isaiah draws a powerful illustration from the kind of voice heard
in such divination, see Isaiah xxix. 4.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt but the Jews became acquainted with
this voice during their compulsory captivity in Egypt. In many
of the mysteries which accompanied the worship of Osiris, the
unearthly voice speaking from hidden depths of unknown heights
was common. Some philosophers have imagined that a series of
tubes and acoustical appliances were used to accomplish these
mysterious sounds. The statute of Memnon will instantly suggest
itself as a familiar instance. The gigantic stone-head was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
heard to speak when the first rays of the worshipped sun glanced
on its impassive features. The magic words were undoubtedly
pronounced by the attendant priest, for we find a similar trick
prevalent throughout the whole history of ventriloquism, and
even now the public professors of the art know how much depends
on fixing the attention of their audience on the object or
place from whence the sound is supposed to proceed. The Jews
carried the art with them into Palestine, for we trace the agency
throughout their history.</p>

<p>The Greeks practised a mode of divination termed gastromancy,
where the diviner replied without moving his lips, so that the
consulter believed he heard the actual voice of a spirit speaking
from its residence within the priest’s belly.</p>

<p>In the Acts of the Apostles (xvi. 16), mention is made of a
young woman with a familiar spirit meeting the Apostles in the
city of Philippi, in Macedonia,—St. Chrysostom and other early
Fathers of the Christian Church mention divination by a familiar
spirit as practised in their day. The practice of similar divination
is still common in the East; it lingers on the banks of the
Nile, and is even practised among the Esquimaux. This divination
by a familiar spirit has been practised upwards of three
thousand years.</p>


<h3><a id="MODERN_PROFESSORS_OF_THE_ART"></a>MODERN PROFESSORS OF THE ART.</h3>

<p>The earliest notice of ventriloquial illusion, as carried out in
modern times, has reference to Louis Brabant, <i lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</i> of
Francis I., who is said to have fallen in love with a beautiful and
rich heiress, but was rejected by the parents as a low, unsuitable
match. However, the father dying, he visits the widow; and on
his first appearance in the house she hears herself accosted in a
voice resembling that of her dead husband, and which seemed to
proceed from above. “Give my daughter in marriage to Louis
Brabant, who is a man of great fortune and excellent character.
I now endure the inexpressible torments of purgatory, for having
refused her to him; obey this admonition and I shall soon be
delivered; you will provide a worthy husband for your daughter,
and procure everlasting repose to the soul of your poor husband.”</p>

<p>The dread summons, which had no appearance of proceeding
from Louis, whose countenance exhibited no change, and whose
lips were close and motionless, was instantly complied with; but
the deceiver, in order to mend his finances for the accomplishment
of the marriage contract, applies to one Cornu, an old and
rich banker at Lyons, who had accumulated immense wealth by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
usury, and extortion, and was haunted by remorse of conscience.
After some conversation on demons and spectres, the pains of purgatory,
&amp;c., during an interval of silence, a voice is heard, like
that of the banker’s deceased father, complaining of his dreadful
situation in purgatory, and calling upon him to rescue him from
thence, by putting into the hands of Louis Brabant, then with
him, a large sum for the redemption of Christians in slavery with
the Turks; threatening him at the same time with eternal damnation
if he did not thus expiate his own sins. Upon a second interview,
in which his ears were saluted with the complaints and
groans of his father, and of all his deceased relations, imploring
him, for the love of God, and in the name of every saint in the
calendar, to have mercy on his own soul and others, Cornu
obeyed the heavenly voice, and gave Louis 10,000 crowns, with
which he returned to Paris, and married his mistress.</p>

<p>The works of M. L’Abbe La Chapelle, issued 1772, and before
alluded to, contain descriptions of the ventriloquial achievements
of Baron Mengen at Vienna; and those of M. St. Gille,
near Paris, are equally interesting and astonishing. The former
ingeniously constructed a doll with moveable lips, which he
could readily control by a movement of the fingers under the
dress; and with this automaton he was accustomed to hold humorous
and satirical dialogues. He ascribed proficiency in his
art to the frequent gratification of a propensity for counterfeiting
the cries of the lower animals, and the voices of persons with
whom he was brought in contact. So expert, indeed, had practice
rendered him in this way, that the sounds uttered by him did
not seem to issue from his own mouth. La Chapelle, having
heard many surprising circumstances related concerning one M.
St. Gille, a grocer at St. Germainen-Laye, near Paris, whose powers
as a ventriloquist had given occasion to many singular and diverting
scenes, formed the resolution of seeing him. Being seated
with him on the opposite side of a fire, in a parlor on the ground
floor, and very attentively observing him, the Abbe, after half an
hour’s conversation with M. St. Gille, heard himself called, on a
sudden, by his name and title, in a voice that seemed to come from
the roof of a house at a distance; and whilst he was pointing to
the house from which the voice had appeared to him to proceed,
he was yet more surprised at hearing the words, “it was not
from that quarter,” apparently in the same kind of voice as before,
but which now seemed to issue from under the earth at one
of the corners of the room. In short, this factitious voice played,
as it were, everywhere about him, and seemed to proceed from
any quarter or distance from which the operator chose to transmit
it to him. To the Abbe, though conscious that the voice proceeded
from the mouth of M. St. Gille, he appeared absolutely
mute while he was exercising his talent; nor could any change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
in his countenance be discovered. But he observed that M.
St. Gille presented only the profile of his face to him while he
was speaking as a ventriloquist.</p>

<p>On another occasion, M. St. Gille sought for shelter from a
storm in a neighboring convent; and finding the community in
mourning, and inquiring the cause, he was told that one of their
body, much esteemed by them, had lately died. Some of their religious
attended him to the church, and showing him the tomb of
their deceased brother, spoke very feelingly of the scanty honors
that had been bestowed on his memory, when suddenly, a
voice was heard, apparently proceeding from the roof of the
choir, lamenting the situation of the defunct in purgatory, and
reproaching the brotherhood with their want of zeal on his account.
The whole community being afterwards convened in the
church, the voice from the roof renewed its lamentations and reproaches,
and the whole convent fell on their faces, and vowed a
solemn reparation. Accordingly, they first chanted a <i lang="la">De profundis</i>
in full choir; during the intervals of which the ghost occasionally
expressed the comfort he received from their pious
exercises and ejaculations in his behalf. The prior, when this
religious service was concluded, entered into a serious conversation
with M. St. Gille, and inveighed against the incredulity of
our modern sceptics and pretended philosophers on the article of
ghosts and apparitions; and St. Gille found it difficult to convince
the fathers that the whole was a deception.</p>

<p>M. St. Gille, in 1771, submitted his attainments in this direction
to several experiments before MM. Leroy and Fouchy, Commissioners
of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and other persons of
exalted rank, in order to demonstrate that his mimicry was so
perfect as to reach the point of complete illusion. For this purpose
a report was circulated that a spirit’s voice had been heard at
times in the environs of St. Germain, and that the commission was
appointed to verify the fact. The company, with the exception
of one lady, were apprised of the real nature of the case, the intention
being to test the strength of the illusion upon her. The
arrangement was that they should dine together in the country, in
the open air; and while they were at table, the lady was addressed
in a supernatural voice, now coming from the top of
adjoining trees, then descending until it approached her, next receding
and plunging into the ground, where it ceased. For upwards
of two hours was this startling manifestation continued
with such adroitness that she was convinced the voice belonged
to a person from another world, and subsequent explanation
failed to convince her to the contrary.</p>

<p>M. Alexandre, the famous ventriloquist, had an extraordinary
facility in counterfeiting all the expressions of countenance and
bodily conditions common to humanity. When in London,
his mimetic powers, which he was fond of exercising both in pub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>lic
and private, made his company in high request among the upper
circles. The Lord Mayor of the City, in particular, received
the ventriloquist with great distinction, and invited him several
times to dine at the Mansion House. But it unluckily happened
that on every occasion when M. Alexandre dined there, he could
not stay to spend the evening, having contracted engagements
elsewhere. The Lord Mayor expressed much regret at this, and
the ventriloquist himself was annoyed on the same account, being
willing to do his best to entertain the guests whom the Lord Mayor
had asked each time to meet him.</p>

<p>At last, on meeting M. Alexandre one day, the Lord Mayor engaged
him to dine at the Mansion House on a remote day. “I fix
it purposely,” said his lordship, “at so distant a period, because
I wish to make sure this time of your remaining with us through
the evening.” Through fear of seeming purposely to slight his
lordship, M. Alexandre did not dare to tell the Mayor that on
that very morning he had accepted an invitation from a nobleman
of high rank to spend at his house the evening of the
identical day so unfortunately pitched on by the civic dignitary.
All the ventriloquist said in reply was, “I promise, my lord to
remain at the Mansion House, till you, yourself think it time for
me to take my leave.” “Ah, well,” said the Lord Mayor, and
he went off perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>At the appointed day Alexandre sat himself down at the magistrate’s
board. Never had the ventriloquist comported himself
with so much spirit and gaiety. He insisted on devoting bumpers
to each and every lady present.</p>

<p>The toasts went round, the old port flowed like water, and the
artiste in particular seemed in danger of loosing his reason under
its potent influence. When others stopped, he stopped not, but
continued filling and emptying incessantly. By and by, his eyes
began to stare, his visage became purple, his tongue grew confused,
his whole body seemed to steam of wine, and finally he
sank from his chair in a state of maudlin, helpless insensibility.</p>

<p>Regretting the condition of his guest, the Lord Mayor got him
quietly lifted, and conveyed to his own carriage, giving orders for
him to be taken home to his lodgings. As soon as M. Alexandre
was deposited there, he became a very different being. It was
now ten o’clock, and but half an hour was left to him to prepare
for his appointed visit to the Duke of ——’s <i lang="fr">soiree</i>. The ventriloquist
disrobed himself, taking first from his breast a quantity of
sponge which he had placed beneath his waist coat, and into the
pores of which he had, with a quick and dexterous hand, poured
the greater portion of the wine which he had apparently swallowed.</p>

<p>Having washed from his person all tokens of his simulated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>toxication,
and dressed himself anew, M. Alexandre then betook
himself to the mansion of the nobleman to whom he had engaged
himself.</p>

<p>On the following day the fashionable newspapers gave a detailed
account of the grand party at his Grace the Duke of ——’s,
and eulogized to the skies the entertaining performances of M.
Alexandre, who, they said, had surpassed himself on this occasion.
Some days afterwards, the Lord Mayor encountered M.
Alexandre. “Ah, how are you?” said his lordship. “Very
well, my lord,” was the reply. “Our newspapers are pretty
pieces of veracity,” said his lordship. “Have you seen the
<cite>Courier</cite> of the other day? Why, it makes you out to have exhibited
in great style last Thursday night at his Grace of ——’s!” “It
has but told the truth,” said the mimic. “What? impossible!”
cried the Mayor. “You do not remember, then, the state into
which you unfortunately got at the Mansion House?” And
thereupon the worthy magistrate detailed to the ventriloquist the
circumstances of his intoxication, and the care that had been
taken with him, with other points of the case. M. Alexandre
heard his lordship to an end, and then confessed the stratagem
which he had played off, and the cause of it.</p>

<p>“I had promised,” said Alexandre, “to be with his Grace at
half-past ten. I had also promised not to leave you till you yourself
considered it fit time. I kept my word in both cases—you
know the way.” The civic functionary laughed heartily, and on
the following evening Alexandre made up for his trick by making
the Mansion House ring with laughter till daylight.</p>

<p>Many anecdotes are told respecting M. Alexandre’s power of
assuming the faces of other people. At Abbotsford, during a
visit there, he actually sat to a sculptor five times in the character
of a noted clergyman, with whose real features the sculptor
was well acquainted. When the sittings were closed and
the bust modelled, the mimic cast off his wig and assumed dress,
and appeared with his own natural countenance, to the terror
almost of the sculptor, and to the great amusement of Sir
Walter and others who had been in the secret.</p>

<p>Of this most celebrated ventriloquist it is related that on
one occasion he was passing along the Strand, when a friend desired
a specimen of his abilities. At this instant a load of hay
was passing along near Temple Bar, when Alexandre called attention
to the suffocating cries of a man in the centre of the hay.
A crowd gathered round and stopped the astonished carter, and
demanded why he was carrying a fellow-creature in his hay.
The complaints and cries of the smothered man now became
painful, and there was every reason to believe that he was dying.
The crowd, regardless of the stoppage to the traffic, instantly
proceeded to unload the hay into the street. The smothered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
voice urged them to make haste, but the feelings of the people
may be imagined when the cart was empty and nobody was found,
while Alexandre and his friend walked off laughing at the unexpected
results of their trick.</p>

<p>It would be obviously invidious to compare the merits of living
professors. Mr. Maccabe, Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Thurton and
Mr. Macmillan have long been favorites with the public.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_THEORY_OF_VENTRILOQUISM"></a>THE THEORY OF VENTRILOQUISM.</h3>

<p>Many physiologists aver that ventriloquism is obtained by
speaking during the inspiration of air. It is quite possible to articulate
under these circumstances, and the plan may with advantage
be occasionally adopted; but our own practical experience
and close observation of many public performers, and of not
a few private friends who have attained distinctness and no
small amount of facility in the art, convince us that the general
current of utterance is, as in ordinary speech, during <em>expiration</em>
of the breath. Some imagine that the means of procuring the
required imitation are comprised in a thorough management of
the echoes of sound. Unfortunately, however, for this theory,
an echo only repeats what has been already brought into existence.
Several eminent ventriloquists, including the late Mr.
Matthews, have displayed the vocal illusion while walking in
the streets. Baron Mengen describes as follows his mode of
speaking, when he desired the illusion to take the direction
of a voice emanating from the doll: “<em>I press my tongue against
the teeth, and then circumscribe a cavity between my left check and
teeth, in which the voice is produced by the air held in reserve in the
pharynx</em>. The sounds thus receive a hollow and muffled tone,
which causes them to appear to come from a distance.” The
Baron furthermore mentions that it is essential to have the breath
well under control, and not to respire more than can be avoided.
M. St. Gille was seen to look somewhat exhausted when the vocal
illusion grew less perfect. We ourselves, and all ventriloquists
with whom we have conferred, have acknowledged that
they have experienced fatigue in the chest, and have attributed
it to the slow expiration of the breath. M. St. Gille, with the
majority of ventriloquists, was often compelled to cough during
the progress of his exercitation.</p>

<p>To attain an exact and positive knowledge of the modifications
of voice specified as ventriloquism, it is important to be familiar
with the distinctions of the sounds uttered by the mouth; and to
ascertain how the organs act in producing those vocal modifications,
it is necessary to know how the breath is vocalized in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
distinctions of pitch, loudness, and quality, by the ordinary actions
of the vocal organs. In ordinary language, we speak of
noise, of common sound, and of musical sound-terms employed
by Dr. Thomas Young in illustrating the mechanical agencies of
articulation:—“A quill striking against a piece of wood causes a
noise, but striking successively against the teeth of a wheel, or of
a comb, a continued sound, and, if the teeth of the wheel are at
equal distances, and the velocity of the rotation is constant, a
musical sound. The general terms—pitch, loudness, quality, and
duration, embrace all the distinctions with which the musician
has to deal, and which he uses in his art.”</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of musical sound is its uniform
pitch throughout its duration, and acoustically musical sound is
composed of an equal number of impulses or noises produced in
equal tones.</p>

<p>The general terms—pitch, loudness, quality, and duration, also
embrace all the distinctions heard in ordinary sounds. These
sounds differ from the musical in the pitch constantly varying
throughout their duration, as the human voice in speaking, and
the voice of quadrupeds. Acoustically such sounds are composed
of an unequal number of impulses or noises produced in equal
tones. And from this circumstance pitch, in the strictly musical
sense, is not a property of ordinary sound.</p>

<p>The general terms—loudness and quality, embrace all the distinctions
heard in a noise, as in the collision of two unelastic
sticks. Pitch and duration can scarcely be considered as belonging
to common noise. Thus we have—(1) noise whose audible
distinctions are comprehended under the general terms loudness
and quality; (2) common sound, whose audible distinctions are
comprehended under the general terms—loudness, quality,
duration, and every varying pitch; (3) musical sound, whose
audible distinctions are comprehended under the general terms—loudness,
quality, duration, and uniform pitch.</p>

<p>Phonation, or the production of voice, is a result of actions
taking place under two distinct classes of laws—namely, the ordinary
mechanical laws of acoustics, and the physiological laws
of muscular movement. The adjustment of the vocal mechanism
to be brought into operation by the current of air, is made by
actions under the latter laws; and phonation is the result of the
reaction of the mechanism on the current of air, by mechanical
movements under the former laws. Now, the pitch of the voice
essentially depends on the tension of the vocal ligaments; the
loudness or the extent of the excursion of these ligaments in their
vibration; the duration on the continuance of the vocalizing
causes; the quality on the organization of the larynx, and also
on the form and size of the vocal tube. The form and size of
this tube can be altered in various ways—for instance, by dilating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
or contracting the pharynx; by dilating or contracting the
mouth; by contracting the communication between the pharynx
and mouth, so as to constitute them distinct chambers, or by dilating
the opening so as to throw them into one, which is chiefly
attained by movements of the soft palate; and by altering the
form of the mouth’s cavity, which is effected by varying the position
of the tongue. Each of these modifications of the vocal tube conveys
a peculiarity of quality to the voice,—all, however, being
local or laryngeal sounds. Moreover, sounds can be produced in
the vocal tube, apart from the larynx. These, strictly speaking,
are not vocal sounds, though some of them may be of a definite and
uniform pitch, while others are mere noises—as rustling, whispering,
gurgling, whistling, snoring, and the like. Now, as everything
audible comes under the classes of noise, sound, or musical
sound, and as each variety originates in the vocal apparatus of man,
it is obvious that <em>an ordinary vocal apparatus is all that is required for
the achievement of the feats</em> of ventriloquism.</p>

<p>A person having an ear acutely perceptive to the nice distinctions
of sounds, may, by a little practice, imitate many sounds
with accuracy. Those persons, however, who are highly endowed
with the mental requisites, which consist of an intense desire
to mimic, coupled with the ability to originate mimetic ideas, are
able to imitate sounds at first hearing.</p>

<p>We next proceed to treat of those illusions, where the voice so
perfectly counterfeits the reality intended, that it appears not to
issue from the mimic, but from an appropriate source, in whatever
direction, and at whatever distance the source may be. We
do not hear the distance which a sound has travelled from its
source, but we judge the distance from our former experience, by
comparing the loudness which we hear with the known distance
and known loudness of similar sounds heard on former occasions.
Common experience will prove that we oftener err in estimating
the distance of uncommon than of familiar sounds. In apology
for such an error, the ordinary language is, “It seemed too loud
to come so far,” or “It seemed too near to be so faint a sound,”
as the case may be,—both of which are apologies for an erroneous
judgment, and not for faulty hearing. Near sounds are louder
than distant ones. Now, by preserving the same <em>pitch</em>, <em>quality</em>, and
<em>duration</em>, but with an <em>accurately graduated reduction of loudness</em>, a series
forming a <em>perspective</em> of sounds may be created, which, falling in
succession on the ear, will suggest to the mind a constantly increasing
distance of the sound’s source. The estimate, then,
which is formed of the distance which a sound has travelled before
reaching the ear is a judgment of the mind formed by comparing
a present perception (by hearing) with the remembrance of
a former loudness in connection with its known distance. With
regard to direction, it is observed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> “The direction whence a sound
comes seems to be judged of by the right of left ear receiving the
stronger impression, which, however, can only take place when
the sound’s source is in a plane, or nearly so, with a line passing
through both cars. It is familiarly known that a person in a
house cannot by the noise of an approaching carriage judge with
certainty whether it is coming from the right or left. He accurately
judges it to be approaching, passing, or receding, as the
case may be, by the gradations of loudness, but is unable to decide
with certainty whether its approach or recession is from up
or down the street. Enough has been stated to show that we do
not <em>hear</em>, but that we judge <em>the direction a sound has travelled from its
source on reaching the ear</em>.” The ventriloquist indicates, either directly
or indirectly, the direction from which he wishes his
audience to believe the sound is coming. Thus he directly indicates
it by words, such as—“Are you up there?” “He is up the
chimney,” “He is in the cellar,” “Are you down there?” &amp;c.,
as illustrated in the various examples. He indirectly indicates it
by some suggestive circumstance, as an action or gesture, which
is so skilfully unobtrusive and natural as to effect its object without
being discovered. Thus, when the ventriloquist looks or
listens in any direction, or even simply turns towards any point,
as if he expected sound to come thence, <em>the attention of an audience
is by that means instantly directed also to the same place</em>. Thus, before a
sound is produced, the audience expect it to come in the <em>suggested
direction</em>; and the ventriloquist has merely, by his <em>adjustment of
vocal loudness</em>, to indicate the necessary distance, when a <em>misjudgment
of the audience will complete the illusion which he has begun</em>.</p>

<p>The effect which is produced on sound by its travelling from a
distance, is observed to be:—</p>

<p>(1) That its loudness is reduced in proportion to its distance.</p>

<p>(2) That its <em>pitch</em> remains unaltered.</p>

<p>(3) That its <em>quality</em> or <em>tone</em> is somewhat altered.</p>

<p>(4) That its duration remains unaltered.</p>

<p>(5) That the human speech is <em>somewhat obscured</em>, chiefly in the
<em>consonant</em> sounds.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the ventriloquist makes the sound,
not as it is heard at its source, <em>but as it is heard after travelling from a
distance</em>.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_MEANS_BY_WHICH_IT_IS_EFFECTED"></a>THE MEANS BY WHICH IT IS EFFECTED.</h3>

<p>Before entering upon the first and easy lessons, it will be as well
to consider the means by which the effect is produced. The Student
is supposed to have made himself thoroughly acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
with the previous chapter, as to the effect to be produced, <em>not on
himself</em>, but <em>on the spectators and audience</em>. And we may assure him,
that if he has a fair range of voice, a diligent observance of the
rules which we are about to lay down, coupled with attention to
the nature of sound as it falls upon the ear, will lead him to such
triumphs as, in all probability, he never imagined he could have
attained—an assurance which we are emboldened to offer from
<em>our own pursuit and practical realization of the art</em>.</p>

<p>The student must bear in mind that the means are <em>simply natural
ones</em>, used in accordance with <em>natural laws</em>. We have given him
the acoustical theory of the effect on the auric nerve, and the
means are the organs of respiration and sound, with the adjoining
muscles. They are the diaphragm, the lungs, the trachea, the
larynx, the pharynx, and the mouth. The diaphragm is a very
large convex muscle, situated below the lungs, and having full
power over respiration. The lungs are the organs of respiration,
and are seated at each side of the chest; they consist of air-tubes
minutely ramified in a loose tissue, and terminating in very small
sacs, termed air-cells. The trachea is a tube, the continuation of
the larynx, commonly called the windpipe: through this the air
passes to and from the lungs. It is formed of cartilaginous rings,
by means of which it may be elongated or shortened. The larynx
is that portion of the air-tube immediately above the trachea: its
position is indicated by a large projection in the throat. In the
interior of this part of the throat are situated the vocal chords.
They are four bands of elastic substance somewhat similar to
India-rubber. The cavity, or opening between these vocal
chords is called the glottis: it possesses the power of expanding
or contracting under the influence of the muscles of the larynx.
The pharynx is a cavity above the larynx, communicating with
the nasal passages: it is partially visible when the mouth is
opened and the tongue lowered. Near this part of the root of the
tongue is situated the epiglottis, which acts as a lid or cover in
closing over the air-tube during the act of swallowing. The mouth
forms a cavity to reflect and strengthen the resonance of the vibrations
produced in the air-tube; it also possesses numberless
minute powers of contraction and modification.</p>

<p>We now proceed to give the instructions to which we have referred—instructions
guaranteed by a proficiency which we are
ever ready to submit to the ordeal of a critical examination, either
in private or in public.</p>

<p>If the student will pay strict attention to the parts printed in
<em>italics</em>, and will practice the voices here specified, he will find that
they are the <em>key to all imitative sounds and voices</em>; and, according to
the range of his voice and the capabilities of his mimetic power,
he will be enabled to imitate the voices of little children, of old
people, and, in fact, almost every sound which he hears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>Too much attention cannot be bestowed on the <i>study of sound as
it falls on the ear</i>, and an endeavor to imitate it as it is heard—<i>for
the “secret” of the art is, that as perspective is to the eye so is
ventriloquism to the ear</i>. When we look at a painting of a landscape,
some of the objects appear at a distance; but we know
that it is only the skill of the artist which has made it appear as
the eye has seen it in reality. In exactly the same manner a ventriloquist
acts upon and deceives the ear, by <i>producing sounds</i> as
they are heard from any known distances.</p>


<h3><a id="PRACTICAL_ILLUSTRATIONS"></a>PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">No. I.</span></p>

<p class="subt">THE VOICE IN THE CLOSET</p>

<p>This is the voice in which Mr. Frederic Maccabe, the celebrated
mimic and ventriloquist, excels, and the clever manner in
which he can adapt it off-hand, as it were, will be best illustrated
by the fact mentioned to us by the gentleman in question, whom
we call Mr. B. in Mr. Maccabe’s presence. Mr. B., who was an
invalid, suffering from some nervous disorder, originating by overwork
and anxiety, was travelling in Ireland in search of health,
and when on his way from Dublin to Cork, he lay exhausted in a
corner of a railway-carriage, muffled up in cloaks and wrappers
in a paroxysm of pain. At Mallow, two gentlemen entered
the carriage, one of whom was in exuberant spirits, and commenced
telling some amusing anecdotes. At length the porter came
to collect the tickets. They were all handed in but one, when the
following colloquy ensued:—</p>

<p><i>Porter.</i>—A gentleman hasn’t given me his ticket.</p>

<p><i>Gentleman.</i>—Bill, in the next compartment, has the ticket, (tapping
at the partition). Haven’t you, Bill?</p>

<p>The imaginary Bill, who appeared to be suffering from a severe
cold, replied that he had, and the porter would not take
it. The official went off to find the ticket, but Bill, in the
mean time had vanished. Back came the porter and indignantly
demanded the ticket. He was interrupted by a shrill
voice in the opposite compartment, crying,—“Porter! porter!
why don’t you come and take the ticket! There’s some one
insulting me!” Away went the chivalric porter, to come back
puzzled and chafed to receive the ticket, which was handed to
him. His hand had not reached the coveted piece of pasteboard,
ere the yell of a terrier under the wheels caused the porter to
draw back, amid bursts of laughter, during which the ticket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
was thrown out, and the train moved on. And Mr. Frederic
Maccabe stood confessed, but not penitent.</p>

<p><i>Voice No 1.</i>—To acquire this voice, which we so name for distinction’s
sake, speak any word or sentence in your own natural
tones; then open the mouth and <i>fix the jaws</i> fast, as though you
were trying to hinder any one from opening them farther or shutting
them; draw the tongue back in a ball; speak the same
words, and the sound, instead of being formed in the mouth will
be formed in the pharynx. Great attention must be paid to
holding the jaws rigid. The sound will then be found to imitate
a voice heard from the other side of a door when it is
closed, or under a floor, or through a wall. To ventriloquize
with this voice, let the operator stand with his back to the audience
against a door. Give a gentle tap at the door, and call
aloud in a natural voice, inquiring “Who is there?” This will
have the effect of drawing the attention of the audience to a
person supposed to be outside. Then fix the jaw as described,
and utter in voice No. 1, any words you please, such as
“I want to come in.” Ask questions in the natural voice and
answer in the other. When you have done this, open the door
a little, and hold a conversation with the imaginary person. As
the door is now open, it is obvious that the voice must be altered,
for a voice will not sound to the ear when a door is open the
same as when closed. Therefore the voice must be made to <i>appear</i>
face to face, or close to the ventriloquist. To do this the
voice must not be altered from the <i>original note</i> or <i>pitch</i>, but be
made in another part of the mouth. This is done by closing the
lips tight and drawing one corner of the mouth downwards, or
towards the ear. Then let the lips open at that corner only, the
other part to remain closed. Next breathe, as it were, the words
out of the orifice formed. Do not speak distinctly, but expel the
breath in short puffs at each word, and as loud as possible. By
so doing you will <i>cause the illusion</i> in the mind of the listeners,
that they hear the same voice which they heard when the door
was closed, but which is now heard more distinctly and nearer
on account of the door being open. This voice must always be
used when the ventriloquist wishes it to appear that the sound
comes from some one close at hand, but through an obstacle.
The description of voice and dialogue may be varied as in the following
examples—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ex. 1. The Suffocated Victim.</span>—This was a favorite illustration
of Mr. Love, the polyphonist. A large box or close cupboard
is used indiscriminately, as it may be handy. The student
will rap or kick the box apparently by accident. The voice will
then utter a hoarse and subdued groan, apparently from the box
or closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span> (<i>pointing to the box with an air of astonishment</i>): What
is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: I won’t do so any more. I am nearly dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Who are you? How came you there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: I only wanted to see what was going on. Let me
out, do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: But I don’t know who you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Oh yes, you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Your old schoolfellow, Tom, ——. You know me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Why, he’s in Canada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>sharply</i>): No he ain’t, he’s here; but be quick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span> (<i>opening the lid</i>): Perhaps he’s come by the underground
railroad? Hallo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>not so muffled as described in direction</i>): Now then, give us
a hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span> (<i>closing the lid or door sharply</i>): No, I won’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>as before</i>): Have pity (<i>Tom, or Jack, or Mr. ——, as the
case may be</i>), or I shall be choked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: I don’t believe you are what you say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Why don’t you let me out and see before I am dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">STUDENT</span> (<i>opening and shutting the lid or door and varying the
voice accordingly</i>): Dead! not you. When did you leave Canada?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Last week. Oh? I am choking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Shall I let him out? (<i>opening the door</i>). There’s no
one here.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap"> The Milkman at the Door.</span>—This affords a capital opportunity
of introducing a beggar, watercress or milkman, and
may be varied accordingly. We will take Skyblue, the milkman;
and we would impress on the student, that, although we give
these <i>simple</i> dialogues, <i>they are merely intended as illustrations for the
modest tyro</i>, not to be implicitly followed when greater confidence
and proficiency are attained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Milk below!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Is it not provoking that a milkman always comes
when he is not wanted, and is absent when we are waiting for
the cream?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: (<i>whistling a bar of “Shoo Fly”</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Oh, yes, always the broken-hearted milkman as if
he was not as happy as a king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>nearer</i>): Milk below! Why, Sally, where’s the can?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Sally will be long in answering, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Sally’s gadding with the police. Milk below!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span> (<i>slightly opening the door</i>): We don’t want any milk, my
good man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: No skim milk for the cat, or cream for tea?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Voice</span>: Watercresses!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Really, this is too bad. Go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: You owe me ten cents for last week’s milk; I was to
wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: This is intolerable. I’ll send for the police.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> [<i>ironically</i>]: Send for Sally and p’lice, I’ll foller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Impudent rascal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Keep your compliments at home, Master Idlebones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span> [<i>opining the door</i>]: I’ll report you to your master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> [<i>louder, as the door is opened</i>]: Will you, young Whippersnapper,
pay us the dime, and let us go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span> offers to pay, while the voice gets weaker in the distance
with “Milk below!” until it becomes inaudible.</p>

<p>A conversation may be held in a similar strain with <i>cellarman</i>:
and, as a rule, the lower notes of the voice will be best for voices
in the basement, and formed as low in the chest as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Thomas, are you coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice below</span> [<i>gruffly</i>]: I should think I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: We are waiting for the beer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> [<i>partly aside</i>]: The longer you wait, the greater our honor.
Mary, have another drop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Why, the scamp is drinking the beer! Thomas!
Who’s there with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Myself. [<i>Aside</i>] Make haste with the pot, Mary; he’s
in such a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: You drinking rascal, how dare you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Coming, sir. The barrel’s nearly empty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: I should think so, tippling as you are at it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Now don’t be saucy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: The fellow is getting intoxicated. Thomas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Wait till I come. I have waited for you many times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: I suppose it is of no use hurrying you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: No, it isn’t, my young tippler. I’m <span class="smcap">COMING</span>! <i>coming!!</i>
coming!!!</p>

<p>From this illustration the student may proceed to try the second
voice.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">No. II.</span></p>

<p><i>Voice No. 2.</i>—This is the more easy to be acquired. It is the
voice by which all ventriloquists make a supposed person speak
from a long distance, or from, or through the ceiling. In the
first place, with your back to the audience, <i>direct their attention</i> to
the ceiling by <i>pointing to it or by looking intently at it</i>. Call loudly,
and ask some question, as though you believed some person to
be concealed there. Make your own voice very distinct, and as
near the lips as possible, inasmuch as that will help the illusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Then in <i>exactly the same tone and pitch</i> answer; <i>but, in order that the
same voice may seem to proceed from the point indicated, the words must
be formed at the back part of the roof of the mouth</i>. To do this the lower
jaw must be drawn back and held there, the mouth open, which
<i>will cause the palate to be elevated and drawn nearer to the pharynx</i>,
and the sound will be reflected in that cavity, and appear to come
from the roof. Too much attention cannot be paid to the manner
in which the breath is used in this voice. When speaking to
the supposed person, expel the words with a deep, quick breath.</p>

<p>When answering in the imitative manner, the breath must be
<i>held back and expelled very slowly and the voice will come in a
subdued and muffled manner</i>, little above a whisper, but so as to be
well distinguished. To cause the supposed voice to come nearer
by degrees, call loudly, and say, “I want you down here,” or
words to that effect. <i>At the same time make a motion downwards with
your hand.</i> Hold some conversation with the voice and cause it
to say, “I am coming,” or, “Here I am,” each time <i>indicating the
descent with the hand</i> (<i>see examples</i>). When the voice is supposed to
approach nearer, the sound must alter, to denote the progress of
the movement. Therefore let the voice at every supposed step,
roll, as it were, by degrees, <i>from the pharynx more into the cavity of the
mouth</i>, and at each supposed step, <i>contracting the opening of the mouth</i>,
until the lips are drawn up as if you were whistling. By so doing
the cavity of the mouth will be very much enlarged. This will
cause the voice to be <i>obscured, and so appear</i> to come nearer by degrees.
At the same time, care must be taken not to articulate the
consonant sounds plainly, as that would cause the disarrangement
of the lips and cavity of the mouth; and in all <i>imitation voices</i> the
consonants must scarcely be articulated at all, <i>especially if the ventriloquist
faces the audience</i>. For example; suppose the imitative
voice is made to say, “Mind what you are doing, you bad boy,”
it must be spoken as if it were written “’ind ’ot you’re doing,
you ’ad whoy.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This kind of articulation may be practised,
by forming the words in the pharynx, and then sending them
out of the mouth by sudden expulsions of the breath clean
from the lungs at every word. This is most useful in ventriloquism,
and to illustrate it we will take <i>the man on the roof</i> as an
illustration. This is an example almost invariably successful,
and is constantly used by skilled professors of the art. As we
have before repeatedly intimated, the eyes and attention of the
audience must be directed to the <i>supposed spot</i> from whence the
illusive voice is supposed to proceed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> It is very rarely that a ventriloquist shows a full face to his audience:
it is only done when he is at a great distance from them, and is
pronouncing the labial sounds, in the manner given, for any movement
of the jaws would help to destroy the illusion.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Only a few minutes. I am coming as fast as I can.</p>

<p>The voice now approaches the door, and is taken up by the
same tone, but produced as in the first voice. As another illustration,
we will introduce the reader to</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Invisible Sweep.</span>—This is a striking example of the
second voice. Let the student pretend to look up the chimney,
and rehearse the following or some similar colloquy:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Are you up there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Yes. Chimley want sweep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Really, it is extraordinary. What are you

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Looking for birds’-nests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Birds’-nests! There are none there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Dick says there be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: Don’t be so stupid. Let I alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: Will you come down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student</span>: To let these ladies and gentlemen see that there are
many strange things between heaven and earth, but not Sam
Lillyvite, the sweep.</p>

<p>Another good illustration is to hold a conversation with a
friend who lives on the first floor, and with whom you can converse
on any subject—as the <i>retired and mysterious student</i>—but the
moment the student can master the elementary sounds, he will
not need our assistance in providing him with dialogues, which,
however simple they may be to read, have <i>an extraordinary effect
when properly spoken</i>.</p>

<h3><a id="POLYPHONIC_IMITATIONS"></a>POLYPHONIC IMITATIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tormenting Bee.</span>—It is related that Mr. Love, when
young, took great delight in imitating the buzzing of insects and
the cries of animals; indeed, it is difficult to decide whether he
or Mr. Thurton most excelled in this particular species of mimetic
illusion. In all imitations of insect noises, the bee should be
heard to hum gently at first, so as in a private party not likely to
attract attention till the right pitch is obtained, and be it remembered
that the sound, without being particularly loud, can be
made to penetrate every corner of a large room. The illusion is
greatly increased by pretending to catch the offending and intrusive
insect. The humble bee, the wasp, and the bluebottle fly are
best to imitate, and afford an agreeable relief to the other exercises
of ventriloquial power. To imitate the tormenting bee, the
student must use considerable pressure on his chest, as if he was
about to groan suddenly, but instead of which, the sound must be
confined and prolonged in the throat; the greater the pressure,
the higher will be the faint note produced, and which will perfectly
resemble the buzzing of the bee or wasp.</p>

<p>Now, to imitate the buzzing of a bluebottle fly, it will be necessary
for the sound to be made with the lips instead of the throat;
this is done by closing the lips very tight, except at one corner,
where a small aperture is left, fill that cheek full of wind, but not
the other, then slowly blow or force the wind contained in the
cheek out of the aperture: if this is done properly, it will cause a
sound exactly like the buzzing of a bluebottle fly. These two instances
will show how necessary it is for the ventriloquist to
study minutely the different effects of sound upon his hearers in
all his exploits. And to make the above properly effective, he
should turn his face to a wall; with a handkerchief strike at the
pretended bee or fly, at the same time pretend to follow his victim
first this way and then that, and finally to “dab” his pocket-handkerchief
on the wall as though he had killed it; the sounds
should be at times suddenly louder and then softer, which will
make it appear as it is heard in different parts of the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Spectre Carpenter.</span>—The noise caused by planing and
sawing wood can also be imitated without much difficulty, and it
causes a great deal of amusement. The student must, however,
bear in mind that every action must be <em>imitated</em> as well as the
noise, for the eye assists to delude the ear. We have even seen
ventriloquists carry this eye-deception so far as to have a few
shavings to scatter as they proceed, and a piece of wood to fall
when the sawing is ended. To imitate planing, the student must
stand at a table a little distance from the audience, and appear to
take hold of a plane and push it forward: the sound as of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
plane is made as though you were dwelling on the last part of the
word hu<i>sh</i>—dwell upon the <i>sh</i> a little, as <i>tsh</i>, and then clip it
short by causing the tongue to close with the palate, then over
again. Letters will not convoy the peculiar sound of sawing—it
must be studied from nature.</p>


<h3><a id="A_MOUNTAIN_ECHO"></a>A MOUNTAIN ECHO.</h3>

<p>Some persons imagine ventriloquism to be an echo; but, as we
have said, an echo only repeats what has been said before—it
could not answer a question.</p>

<p>An echo is reflected sound, and the reflecting body must be at
such a distance that the interval between the perception of the
original and reflected sounds may be sufficient to prevent them
from being blended together. No reflecting surface will produce
a distant echo, unless its distance from the spot where the sound
proceeds is at least 56&frac12; feet, because the shortest interval sufficient
to render sounds distinctly appreciable by the ear is about one-tenth
of a second; therefore, if sounds follow at a shorter interval,
they will form a resonance instead of an echo; and the time
a sound would take to go and return from a reflecting surface, 56&frac12; feet
distance, would be one-tenth of a second.</p>

<p>It would, therefore, be impossible for a ventriloquist to produce
an echo in a room of ordinary size, as the walls, being so near,
would cause the sounds to be blended, and would only produce
one impression on the ear; and yet the skilled ventriloquist can
with ease imitate, in a room, a mountain echo. We will give the
instructions, as it is very amusing.</p>

<p>Turn your back to the listeners; whistle loud several short,
quick notes, just as if you were whistling for a dog; then, as
quick as possible, after the last note, and as softly and subdued as
possible to be heard, whistle about a third the number of notes,
but it must be in <em>the same note or pitch</em>; this will cause the last
whistle to appear just like an echo at a great distance. This imitation,
if well done, never fails to take the listeners by surprise,
and causes astonishment. The same thing can be done by shouting.
Call aloud any sentence, such as—“Holloa, you there!”
Let your voice be formed close to the lips; then quickly, and
mind in the <em>same pitch or note</em>, speak the same words very subdued
and formed at the back of the mouth. This is not difficult, and
is very effective.</p>


<h3><a id="POINTS_TO_BE_REMEMBERED"></a>POINTS TO BE REMEMBERED.</h3>

<p>In giving the succeeding instructions, it must be borne in mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
that the power and acuteness of hearing is possessed in a greater
or less degree by different individuals, and depends upon the sensibility
of the auric nerves. It will not be out of place nor uninteresting
to show the effect of sound and the manner in which it
is heard by the organs of the ear. It is said that the human ear is
capable of appreciating as many as twenty-four thousand vibrations
in a second, and that the whole range of human hearing,
from the lowest note of the organ to the highest known cry of insects,
as of the cricket, includes nine octaves.</p>

<p>Sound first strikes the drum or tympanum, a thin membrane
which closes the aperture of the ear; when this drum vibrates by
the sonorous undulations of the external air; the vibrations are
communicated by minute bones, muscles, and fluid in the cavity
of the ear, and are then conveyed to the brain; and to show how
absolutely necessary it is that all the organs of the would-be ventriloquist
should be entire and without fault to succeed well, we
will show how the ventriloquist makes that nice distinction of the
gradation of sound, and by which he is enabled to judge whether
he is causing his voice <em>to appear</em> at the proper distance from his
audience or not.</p>

<p>Let any one firmly close both ears by stopping them, then speak
a few words; now, as the cars are stopped, the sound cannot
enter immediately to the drum of the ear, but it takes cognizance
of the sound by a passage called the eustachian tube, which extends
from the back part of the mouth to the cavity immediately
behind the drum of the ear.</p>

<p>The sound vibrations made in the mouth are transmitted along
this tube to the interior part of the organs of hearing. Now it is
by a nice judgment of sound by this tube that the professional
ventriloquist judges the majority of his voices, especially
those greatly obscured or muffled. Not only must the auric nerves
of the would-be ventriloquist be perfect, but he will become more
proficient as he is able to study and understand the human voice.
There is the language of emotion, or natural language. When
we say natural, we mean the language by which the feelings manifest
themselves without previous teaching, and which is recognized
and felt without teaching. Some of them are the scream of
terror, the shout of joy, the laugh of satisfaction, laugh of sarcasm,
ridicule, &amp;c., which are made by man, and understood by fellow-men,
whatever may be the speech or country of the other.</p>

<p>There are also distinct qualities of voice, peculiar to each person,
both in tone and quality, and the best practice is to try and
imitate three or four people’s voices, and let them be of a different
tone and pitch.</p>

<p>The ordinary compass of the voice is about twelve notes, and a
very good practice to the attainment of the art is to call aloud in
a certain note, <em>and then in the octave to that note</em>; do this several times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
a day, changing the note, also speak a sentence all in the same
note or pitch, properly called intonation, loud at first, and then by
degrees lower; this kind of practice will enable the ear to judge
of the modulation required to make a voice appear to recede or
come near by degrees.</p>


<h3><a id="CONCLUDING_REMARKS"></a>CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h3>

<p>When the student is acquainted with the voices before described,
he may imitate many others by <em>contraction and expansion of the
glottis, and by modification of the cavity of the pharynx and mouth</em>. The
best way to practice is in a room by himself, to talk loud, and,
while so doing, to make all sorts of <em>contortions with the muscles of the
mouth and jaws—first fixing the jaws</em> in the manner already described,
<em>then drawing the lips inward, next putting them forward, at the same time
putting the tongue in different shapes and positions in the mouth</em>; also by
speaking in the natural voice, and answering in the <em>falsetto pitch</em>,
which is the imitating voice for women and children.</p>

<p>We are confident that enough has been said to enable any one
with a good range of voice to attain proficiency in the art; the
student always remembering (and it cannot be too often repeated)
that <em>to render a voice perspective, the most essential thing is to attend to
the study of sound as it falls upon the ear; then imitate that sound by
the different contractions and expansions of the muscles of the throat,
mouth, face and jaws</em>. During these various contractions and expansions,
draw in a long breath and talk, first rapidly, then slowly,
but always with a <em>slow expiration of breath</em>. Do this a dozen
times consecutively for several days, at the same time taking particular
care to <em>elevate and depress the roof of the mouth</em>, especially the
back part, as this movement will cause the voice to appear near,
or at a distance. Ample directions have been given how all this is
done, but let it be understood that it is most essential. The student
may then practice before a friend, and he will be astonished
to find that he can deceive any listener, as to the point from which
the sound comes; and will be gratified that he has become the
source of great amusement to himself as well as in the circle in
which he moves.</p>

<p>Thus we have acquired a working power in the art which, we
trust, we have now explained to the satisfaction of the reader.
The progress of the student will, of course, be facilitated by an
inherent propensity of mimicry, which often approaches some of
the minor attainments of ventriloquism. In every company some
person may be found who, without any professional instruction,
can give admirable imitations, of the voice, gait, and peculiarities
of a friend or acquaintance; thus proving that Nature, to some
extent, supplies the basis upon which, if we may use the phrase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
the complete superstructure of vocal illusion may be raised. The
possession of this quality would amount, comparatively, to little,
without instruction and perseverance. Here, as in other respects,
practice makes perfect; and, more than that, a diligent application
of our rules will invest the originally defective amateur with
an attainment which the ignorant will attribute to the possession
of a supernatural gift.</p>

<p>All we need say in conclusion is, that the rules propounded will
not only clear away imaginary difficulties from the path of the
student, but entitle him, like ourselves, to an acquirement more
or less near perfection, according to a natural gift of mimicry, and
to the zeal with which he may study and practice the art.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_MAGIC_WHISTLE"></a>THE MAGIC WHISTLE.</h3>

<p>It will be pleasant when the wind is howling without, among
the snow-laden limbs of the trees, to be reminded of the gay summer
by the counterfeit notes of the woodland songsters; or, wandering
among the woods and fields in spring or summer time,
how glorious to challenge the feathered musicians to a contest of
skill with you in their own sweet language. We propose to instruct
the reader in the manufacture of a little instrument by
which the notes of birds, voices of animals, and various peculiar
sounds may be imitated.</p>

<p>First, look at the annexed diagram, and then procure a leek and
cut off from the green leaf thereof a piece about the size of the
diagram; then lay it on a smooth table, and with the thumb-nail
delicately scrape away a small semi-circular patch of the green
pulpy substance of the leaf [as represented in the diagram], being
careful to leave the fine membrane of outer skin of the leaf uninjured—and
there is the instrument complete. It may require
several experiments to make the first one, but once having discovered
the right way, they are very easily manufactured. The
reader may not be aware of the fact that the leaf of the leek has a
fine transparent outer skin, which is quite tough, but by breaking
and carefully examining one or two leaves, he will soon find out
what we allude to.</p>

<p>The way of using this instrument is to place it in the roof of the
mouth with the side on which is the membrane downwards; then
place it gently in its place with the tongue, and blow between the
tongue and the upper teeth. After the first two or three attempts,
you will be able to produce a slight sound like a mild grunt; then
as you practice it you will find you can prolong and vary the
sound somewhat, so that in the course of a couple of days you can
imitate the barking of a dog and the neighing of a horse. With
two or three weeks’ practice, you will be able to imitate some of
the song birds; but to produce exact counterfeits of the best singing
birds will probably require months of study; the result, however,
will reward you for all your pains, for certainly to be able
to carry a mocking bird, canary, thrush, cat-bird and sucking-pig
in your vest pocket, is no small accomplishment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="Leaf of Leek" />
</div>


<p>When not using the instrument, it should be kept in a glass of
water to prevent its drying.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
